# Lesson 19: お時間を頂いてしまい、申し訳ありません (Ojikan o Itadaite Shimai, Mōshiwake Arimasen)

## Apologizing for Taking Someone's Time

**English Title:** Dealing with ambiguous complaints

---

## Role-play Setup

You are a server/waitress at a restaurant. Two customers have been waiting for their food for quite a while, and they're starting to get impatient. One customer makes a vague complaint about the wait without directly demanding anything. You need to handle the situation professionally - acknowledge the wait, apologize sincerely, explain the situation without making excuses, and provide realistic expectations about when the food will arrive.

## Full Script & Explanation

### Scene 1: Customers Waiting

**Customer A:**  
料理、なかなか来ないわねぇ。  
*Ryōri, nakanaka konai wa nē.*  
Our order is taking forever…

> **Grammar Note:** 「料理、なかなか来ないわねぇ」is a conversational form of「料理がなかなか来ない」. The「～わねえ」at the end of the phrase is used to add femininity. It tends to be used by older women.

**Customer B:**  
そうだね。混んでるからかな。  
*Sō da ne. Konderu kara ka na.*  
You're right. It's pretty busy, I guess.

> **Grammar Note:** 「混んでるからかな」is an attempt to find a reason why the order hasn't come out yet.「～からかな」is a phrase used among people you are familiar with.「混んでいる」is the standard form of the word, but here, the「い」is omitted to make the more conversational「混んでる」.

**Customer B:**  
ちょっと、聞いてみましょうか。  
*Chotto, kiite mimashō ka.*  
Let's ask about it.

> **Grammar Note:** The「～てみます」in「ちょっと、聞いてみましょうか」means「試しに～する」, or to try something.「～ましょうか」is used when making an offer.「ちょっと、聞いてみましょうか」is a phrase that a speaker can use to engage a listener and make an offer.

### Scene 2: Calling the Server

**Customer:**  
すみません。  
*Sumimasen.*  
Excuse me!

> **Grammar Note:** Here, this common phrase is used to call a waitress.

**Server:**  
はい、ただいま参ります。  
*Hai, tadaima mairimasu.*  
Yes, coming.

> **Grammar Note:** 「ただいま参ります」is a humble form of「すぐに行きます」and is appropriate when addressing superiors or customers.

---

### Scene 3: Checking the Order

**Customer:**  
あの、「グリルステーキ盛り合わせ」って注文していましたっけ。  
*Ano, "guriru sutēki moriawase" tte chūmon shite imashita kke.*  
Uh, did I order the steak platter?

> **Grammar Note:** 「あの」is used to show hesitation.「～って注文していましたっけ」is a conversational form of「～を注文していましたか」.「っけ」adds a more casual or familiar nuance.「グリルステーキ盛り合わせ」is a menu item that features several different types of meat on one platter.

**Server:**  
確認してまいります。少々お待ちください。  
*Kakunin shite mairimasu. Shōshō omachi kudasai.*  
Let me check on that for you. Just a moment, please.

> **Grammar Note:** 「確認してまいります」is a humble form of「確認してきます」and is appropriate when addressing superiors or customers.「少々」is a more polite form of「少し」.

---

### Scene 4: Returning with Information

**Server:**  
大変申し訳ございません。  
*Taihen mōshiwake gozaimasen.*  
I deeply apologize.

> **Grammar Note:** 「大変申し訳ございません」is a very polite apology.「どうもすみません」and「申し訳ないです」are often used when making apologies, but they may not be enough in some situations. When making a sincere apology, it's important to bow deeply.

**Server:**  
注文は入っているのですが、もう少々お待ちいただけますか。  
*Chūmon wa haitte iru no desu ga, mō shōshō omachi itadakemasu ka.*  
Your order is being made. Could you please wait just a little longer?

> **Grammar Note:** 「～のですが、」is being used to politely explain the situation to the customer.「～のですが」is slightly more polite than「～んですが」.「もう少々お待ちいただけますか」shares the same meaning as「もう少し待ってください」, but「もう少々」and「お待ちいただけますか」are more polite and thus appropriate when addressing customers.

**Customer:**  
そうですか…。  
*Sō desu ka...*  
I see.

> **Grammar Note:** The「か」at the end of「そうですか…。」is being stretched out to show displeasure. A shorter「そうですか。」with a falling intonation has the nuance of「わかりました。」. Please do pay attention to intonation and the lengthening of a sound at the end of an utterance.

### Scene 5: Additional Complaint

**Customer B:**  
そういえば、「にんにくのホイル焼き」もまだ来てないね。  
*Sō ieba, "ninniku no hoiruyaki" mo mada kite nai ne.*  
Hey, we still didn't get our garlic dish, either.

> **Grammar Note:** 「そういえば」is a phrase that shows the speaker has remembered something thanks to something that the listener has just said. After realizing that the「グリルステーキ」hasn't arrived, the speaker remembered that the「にんにくホイル焼き」hadn't come either, and so uses「そういえば」.

**Customer A:**  
そうよねぇ。今日は店員さんが少ないんですか。  
*Sō yo nē. Kyō wa ten'in-san ga sukunai n desu ka.*  
That's right. Are you understaffed today?

> **Grammar Note:** The speaker is likely being sarcastic here.「そうよねぇ」expresses agreement.「よねぇ」shows femininity. The meaning is the same as「そうだね」, but「そうだね」is more neutral and can be used between familiars with no regard to gender.

---

### Scene 6: Explaining the Situation

**Server:**  
いえ、今日はあいにく混みあっておりまして…。  
*Ie, kyō wa ainiku komiatte orimashite...*  
No, we're unfortunately quite crowded today…

> **Grammar Note:** 「いえ」is a response to the listener's question. It's useful to use this when responding to a question, but it is important not to use it too abruptly. For information on「あいにく」, see the Vocabulary section.「混みあっておりまして…」is a more polite form of「混みあっていて…」（混みあっています）(to be crowded). The ellipsis「…」at the end of the sentence indicates a pause, and regret. When in doubt, it is better to add「すみません」or「申し訳ありません」at the end of the sentence to show greater regret.

**Customer A:**  
お客さんが多くていいですね。  
*Okyaku-san ga ōkute ii desu ne.*  
Must be nice to be busy!

> **Grammar Note:** Based on the context, it can be inferred that the speaker is being critical here, and not complimentary. The same expression, when used in a different situation, may have an entirely different meaning. Even if it is said with a smile, it may not be meant in a friendly way.

## 🔑 KEY PHRASE

**お時間を頂いてしまい、申し訳ありません。**  
***Ojikan o itadaite shimai, mōshiwake arimasen.***  
**I'm sorry it's taking so long.**

> **Explanation:**  
> This is a sophisticated apology that acknowledges you've taken up the customer's valuable time:
> 1.「お時間を」- "your time" (with honorific お)
> 2.「頂いて」- "received" (humble form of もらって)
> 3.「しまい」- regrettable action marker (shows remorse)
> 4.「申し訳ありません」- "I apologize" (formal apology)
> 
> This is a response to the previous comment「お客さんが多くていいですねぇ」. This phrase lets the listener know that the speaker feels strong regret about the long wait. Making customers worried or upset is not good おもてなし, so the speaker is apologizing for that. The「てしまい」structure shows that the action (taking their time) is regrettable.

### Scene 7: Asking for More Patience

**Server:**  
今しばらくお待ちください。  
*Ima shibaraku omachi kudasai.*  
Please wait a little longer.

> **Grammar Note:** 「今しばらく」is often used in the business scene. It's a polite way to ask someone to wait a little bit longer, and is often used when speaking with customers or clients. In this restaurant situation, it's a perfect phrase.

## Vocabulary

### 盛り合わせ (もりあわせ) - moriawase - platter, combo

「盛り合わせ」is a menu item that features several different types of food on one platter. It allows you to sample a little bit of everything. It can be hard to know just how much food a 盛り合わせ will have, so when in doubt, just ask. For example,「3人で食べますがどのくらいの量でしょうか」(Will this be enough for three people?)

**Usage examples:**
- デザート盛り合わせ - Dessert platter
- お刺身盛り合わせ - Sashimi platter
- 前菜盛り合わせ - Appetizer platter
- フルーツ盛り合わせ - Fruit platter

### あいにく - ainiku - unfortunately

「あいにく」is used to communicate that something was unexpected and unfortunate. It includes a sense of apology, along the lines of「すみませんが…」. It's also used to turn down invitations.

**Usage examples:**
- （電話で）あいにく山田は今席におりませんが…。  
  (On the phone) Unfortunately, Yamada is away from his desk right now.
- （会う日を決める）申し訳ありませんが、その日はあいにく先約がありまして。他の日はいかがでしょうか。  
  (When making plans) I'm sorry, but unfortunately I have a prior commitment on that day. Are you available another day?

### 今しばらく (いましばらく) - ima shibaraku - a little longer

「今しばらく」shares the same meaning as「もう少し」. The definition of「少し」can vary from person to person.「今しばらく」is somewhere between「今すぐ」and「しばらく」. It means "not right away, but not too long from now."「少々お待ちください」refers to a short amount of time. However, if one says「5分お待ちください」, and then the action takes longer than 5 minutes, this will further irritate the customer. It is not common in the business world to keep customers or clients waiting, but when doing so, use「今しばらく」. Adding a reason for the wait, such as in「準備をしておりますので、今しばらくお待ちください。」(We are preparing now, so please wait just a little longer.) is more polite.

**Usage examples:**
- 在庫を確認して参りますので、今しばらくお待ちください。  
  I'll check to see if we have that in stock, so please wait just a little longer.
- ただいま中村は接客中でございます。今しばらくお待ちいただいてもよろしいでしょうか。  
  Nakamura is speaking with a client right now. Could you please wait just a moment?

### 混む (こむ) - komu - to be crowded

Used to describe crowded places or busy times.

### なかなか - nakanaka - quite, not easily (with negative)

When used with negative verbs, means "not easily" or "taking a long time."

## Cultural Notes

### Handling Customer Complaints Indirectly

Japanese customers often express displeasure indirectly rather than making direct complaints:
- Making observations: "The food isn't here yet"
- Sarcastic comments: "Must be nice to be busy"
- Questions implying criticism: "Are you understaffed?"

Staff must recognize these as complaints and address them seriously even though they're not direct.

### Omotenashi (おもてなし) - Japanese Hospitality

The concept of おもてなし in Japanese service:
- Anticipate needs before being asked
- Never make excuses
- Apologize sincerely for any inconvenience
- Bow when apologizing
- Use formal, humble language
- Take responsibility even for things beyond your control

### Managing Expectations Without Over-Promising

Important principles:
- Don't say「大丈夫です」(It'll be okay) unless 100% certain
- Use「今しばらく」instead of specific time frames
- Explain the situation without making excuses
- Apologize for the inconvenience caused
- Keep customers informed
