#33
Dealing with a complaint from a neighbor
ご迷惑をおかけして申し訳ありません。今後、清掃のルールを徹底させます。
I&apos;m sorry we were a nuisance. We&apos;ll be extra careful from now on.
Role-play Setup
You work as a carpenter, helping to construct homes. After your lunch break, a neighbor approaches with something to say.
あのー、すみません。
Anoo, sumimasen.
Excuse me.
「すみません。」is often used when striking up a conversation. 「あの」or「あのー」are used before beginning a new topic. It&apos;s common to add「あの」or「あのー」before「すみません。」when beginning a conversation with someone you don&apos;t know.
ちょっといいですか。
Chotto ii desu ka.
Do you have a minute?
When beginning a conversation with someone who is working, ask them for a moment of their time with 「今ちょっとお時間いいですか。」. In this case, the speaker omits「今」and「お時間」and simply asks「ちょっといいですか。」.
はい。
Hai.
Yes
このペットボトル、お宅が出したごみじゃない？
Kono pettobotoru, otaku ga dashita gomi ja nai?
Did you toss this plastic bottle?
「ペットボトル」, or &quot;PET bottle&quot;, is a plastic bottle. The abbreviation PET comes from Polyethyleneterephthalate, which is a type of plastic. If you are an English speaker and have never heard this phrase before, don&apos;t worry. The phrase &quot;PET bottle&quot; was created by Japanese people using the abbreviation &quot;PET&quot; and the English word &quot;bottle.&quot; Phrases like these are known as「和製英語」, or &quot;Japanese-made English.&quot;
「お宅」is a way of referring to someone you don&apos;t know, often used when making complaints. It&apos;s being used in the place of「あなた」here.
In spoken Japanese,「では」often becomes「じゃ」. The phrase「●●●じゃない？」is a casual form of「●●●ではありませんか。」.
どちらに落ちてましたか。
Dochira ni ochite mashita ka.
Where did you find it?
「どちら」is a polite way to say「どこ」.
The 「い」from 「落ちていましたか」is omitted to create「落ちてましたか」. In spoken Japanese, the「い」is often omitted in this way.
うちの前の道路よ。
Uchi no mae no dooro yo.
On the street in front of my house.
In this case,「うち」is being used to refer to「私の家」, or the speaker&apos;s house. 「私の」is omitted.
Here,「よ」is added at the end of the sentence because the speaker is sharing something the listener does not know. In this situation, the speaker is answering the question about where the litter was found.
Saikin, uchi no mawari ni poi-sute ga fueta yoona ki mo suru no yone.
I&apos;m seeing a lot of litter around here these days.
「ぽい捨て」is litter.
「●●●ような気がする」is used to show what you think or feel, even if there may not be a specific reason behind it. When making complaints, you can soften expressions by using this phrase.
Changing「気がする」to「気もする」makes it even gentler.
私たちが出したごみではないと思いますが…。
Watashitachi ga dashita gomi dewa nai to omoimasu ga...
I don&apos;t believe it&apos;s our trash...
「ごみを出す」means to throw away trash.
When expressing an opinion, you can add 「と思います」afterward. When you aren&apos;t confident in what you have said, add 「が」after 「思います」to show uncertainty, like this:「と思いますが、私が間違っているかもしれません。」. The part following「が」is often omitted. When expressing an opinion that differs from a superior&apos;s opinion, use「と思いますが…。」to be more roundabout and polite
ごみの処理は、十分気をつけておりますので。
Gomi no shori wa, juubun ki o tsukete orimasu node.
We&apos;re very careful about the disposal of garbage.
「気をつけております」is a polite version of「気をつけています」.
In this case, the sentence could be extended to read 「ごみの処理は、十分気をつけていますので、道にごみを捨てることはありません。」, but here the latter part is omitted.
そう？
Soo?
Really?
「そう？」is a shorter version of「本当にそうですか。」.
Here, the speaker doesn&apos;t believe what the listener has said. They pronounce「そう？」with a rising intonation to show doubt.
If the speaker believed the listener, they would say「そう。」with a falling intonation, to mean「そうですか。分かりました。」.
すみません。
Sumimasen.
Excuse me.
あっ、それ、僕が飲み終えたペットボトルです。
A, sore, boku ga nomioeta pettobotoru desu.
Oh, that&apos;s my plastic bottle.
「あっ」is used when you suddenly discover or remember something. Here, the speaker is surprised to see their plastic bottle again.
By using「終えた」to describe things that you&apos;ve finished, it creates a stronger impression of being done. For example, if you talk about a task you finished by saying「仕事を終えた」rather than「仕事が終わった」, it creates an impression that you worked hard on the task and have done as much as you can.
Here, the speaker uses「飲み終えた」to describe the plastic bottle to show that he was the one who drank from it.
風で飛ばされてしまったようです。
Kaze de tobasarete shimatta yoodesu.
The wind must have blown it away.
「ようです」is used to describe what you think based on your observations. Here, the speaker believes that the wind must have blown away the bottle into the street after he finished drinking it.
「飛ばされる」is the passive form of「飛ばす」.
When you feel regret about something, you can use the -te form of a verb and add「しまいました」. In this case, 「飛ばされた」becomes「飛ばされてしまった」.
ほらね、もう、気をつけてくださいね。
Hora ne, moo, ki o tsukete kudasai ne.
See? You be more careful.
「ほら」is being used to draw the attention of others. Here, the speaker is using it to highlight 「ペットボトルは会社の人が捨てたごみだ」, and that she correctly assumed the plastic bottle came from the construction site.
「ね」is used at the end of sentences as a confirmation.
To emphasize an opinion, use「もう」in front of it. When angry or making a complaint, even just using 「もう！」or「まったく、もう！」 shows that you are upset.
ご迷惑をおかけして申し訳ありません。今後、清掃のルールを徹底させます。
Gomeewaku o okakeshite mooshiwake arimasen. Kongo, seesoo no ruuru o tettee-sasemasu.
I&apos;m sorry we were a nuisance. We&apos;ll be extra careful from now on.
The speaker apologizes right away for the nuisance. Then, they tell the listener how they will be careful to avoid making the same mistake in the future.
「徹底」means「細かいところまで完全にする」, or to be very thorough about something. Here, the speaker uses it to mean「社員全員が仕事のごみの片付け方をよく理解して、きちんとするようにします。」, or that they will make sure that all employees understand how to properly dispose of trash.
じゃ、よろしくお願いします。
Ja, yoroshiku onegai-shimasu.
Please do.
Kanji:

Keigo:
いただきます(I’d love to
drink)
Tips from this Dialogue
お宅
otaku
you
「宅」from「お宅」means「住むところ」, or one&apos;s home. When asking politely where someone lives, you could ask: 「お宅はどちらですか。」.
「お宅」is also used instead of「あなた」when speaking with someone unfamiliar to you, particularly when making complaints. Don&apos;t use「お宅」with friends or superiors, as it would be rude.
ぽい捨て
poi-sute
litter
There are many Japanese words that are used to describe sounds or appearances. 「ぽい」creates a mental image of something being tossed or thrown away. It&apos;s also written 「ポイ」.
「ぽい捨て」refers to litter, or trash that&apos;s been left on the street. You can see signs and posters all over Japan that say「ぽい捨て禁止」and「ポイ捨て禁止」: No Littering!
In some cases, people who litter may have to pay fines.

登山をしているとき「ぽい捨て禁止」の看板を何度も見た。Tozan o shiteiru toki「poi-sute kinshi」no kanban o nando mo mita.I saw lots of signs saying &quot;No Littering&quot; when I went mountain climbing.
ルール
ruuru
rule
「ルール」is the Japanese version of the English word &quot;rule.&quot; In Japanese, the word 「規則」can also be used to refer to rules. They mean the same thing, but「ルール」is more commonly used in sports. For rules at schools or companies, 「規則」is more common. Company rules are called「社則」, and school rules are called 「校則」.
「決まり」is also used to refer to rules, but these are usually more general and vague.
