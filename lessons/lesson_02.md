# Lesson #2: すみませんが、もう一度言っていただけますか (Sumimasen ga, moo ichido itte itadakemasu ka)

## Asking Someone Politely to Repeat Something

**English Title:** Would you please repeat that?

---

## Role-play Setup

You work at a media company writing articles about restaurants. Your coworker informs you that a curry restaurant in Shibuya postponed its opening. Your supervisor uses many katakana (loanword) terms like "リスケ" (reschedule), "マター" (matter/person in charge), which you don't fully understand. You need to ask for clarification politely.

---

## Full Script & Explanation

### Scene 1: News About the Restaurant

**Coworker (同僚):**  
渋谷のカレー屋さんから電話がありました。  
*Shibuya no karee-ya-san kara denwa ga arimashita.*  
That Shibuya curry place called.

**Supervisor (上司):**  
来週開店する渋谷のカレー屋さんか。  
*Raishuu kaiten-suru Shibuya no karee-ya-san ka.*  
The one that's opening next week?

> **Explanation:** This is an abbreviated spoken form of「来週開店する渋谷のカレー屋さんのことですか」→ Do you mean the one that's opening next week? This expression would be appropriate for use among equals, or from superiors to subordinates.

**Coworker:**  
はい、開店が来月になったそうです。  
*Hai, kaiten ga raigetsu ni natta soo desu.*  
Yes. Seems like the opening has been pushed back to next month.

> **Explanation:** The expression「～そうです」is used to relay information that one has been told. This sentence explains the fact that the opening has been pushed back to next month. Rather than「開店は来月だそうです」, use「なった」to create「来月になったそうです」. This shows that the opening date went from being undecided to decided, or that the decided opening date changed.

### Scene 2: Discussing the Schedule

**Supervisor:**  
それなら記事のアップもリスケだね。  
*Sore nara kiji no appu mo risuke da ne.*  
We must reschedule uploading the article, then.

> **Explanation:**「アップ」means upload.「リスケ」means reschedule.

**Supervisor:**  
リライトを合わせると、少しバッファーがいるね。  
*Riraito o awaseru to, sukoshi baffaa ga iru ne.*  
With the rewrite, we'll need some buffer time, too.

> **Explanation:**「リライト」means rewrite.「バッファー」means buffer. Depending on one's place of work, katakana words can be very common. In particular, IT companies and consulting firms use a lot of katakana words. However, using words like this too much can make sentences difficult to understand, so it's best not to overuse them.

**Supervisor:**  
ちょっといいかな。  
*Chotto ii ka na.*  
Do you have a minute?

> **Explanation:** This expression is used by superiors to subordinates. For subordinates talking to superiors, the following are appropriate:「すみませんが、今少しよろしいでしょうか」,「今、お時間ありますか」. The superior will say something like:「いいですよ」,「はい、何でしょうか」. Now you can proceed with what you want to say.

**Supervisor:**  
この件は誰マターかな。  
*Kono ken wa dare-mataa ka na.*  
Who's in charge of this job?

> **Explanation:** This phrase uses the English word "matter" to ask who is in charge of a task.

***Sumimasen ga, moo ichido itte itadakemasu ka.***  
**Would you please repeat that?**

> **Explanation:**

### Clarification

**Student:**  
すみません。  
*Sumimasen.*  
I'm sorry.

> **Explanation:**「すみません」is used in a variety of situations. In this case, this phrase is an apology for not catching what the other person said. It's also being used as a way to get the listener's attention.

**Student:**  
「誰マター」とはどのような意味でしょうか。  
*"Dare-mataa" to wa dono yoo na imi deshoo ka.*  
What does "dare-mataa" mean?

> **Explanation:** Phrases like「どのような」and「どんな」allow you to make questions more polite than just「『誰マター』とはなんですか？」or「『誰マター』とは何でしょうか？」. When asking for clarification, it's helpful to repeat what the other person said. This lets the other person know which parts you understood, and which parts you didn't understand. It helps them to avoid needlessly repeating themselves.

**Supervisor:**  
誰が担当するか、ってことだよ。  
*Dare ga tantoo-suru ka, tte koto da yo.*  
It means, "Who's in charge?"

> **Explanation:**「～ってことだよ」is a casual form of「～ということですよ」.

**Student:**  
それはカイルさんです。  
*Sore wa Kairu-san desu.*  
That would be Kyle.

**Supervisor:**  
わかった、私からカイルさんに言っておくよ。  
*Wakatta, watashi kara Kairu-san ni itte oku yo.*  
Got it. I will let Kyle know.

> **Explanation:**「言っておくよ」is a casual form of「言っておきます」. Between people who are close, the phrase can be changed to「言っとくよ」. You use「とく -toku」instead of「ておく -te oku」:「伝えておく」→「伝えとく」(tell),「話しておく」→「話しとく」(talk).

**Student:**  
わかりました。  
*Wakarimashita.*  
Understood.

## Cultural Notes

### Katakana Business Jargon

Many Japanese workplaces, especially IT companies and consulting firms, use extensive katakana loanwords. These words are often shortened versions of English terms:

**Common examples:**
- スマホ (sumaho) ← スマートフォン (smartphone)
- プレゼン (purezen) ← プレゼンテーション (presentation)
- メンテ (mente) ← メンテナンス (maintenance)
- インフラ (infura) ← インフラストラクチャー (infrastructure)

**Japanese + English hybrids:**
- 誰マター (dare-mataa) - who + matter = who's in charge?

Even some Japanese people may not know the meaning of these terms at first! When you aren't certain of the meaning, be sure to ask for clarification. It's better to ask than to misunderstand an important task.

### Asking for Clarification is Encouraged

In Japanese business culture, asking for clarification is not seen as weakness - it's professional. Better to confirm understanding than to make mistakes. Use polite phrases like:
- 「どのような意味でしょうか」(What does that mean?)
- 「もう一度お願いします」(One more time, please)

### Using「すみません」Strategically

「すみません」serves multiple purposes:

This multi-purpose nature makes it essential in polite communication.

### Repeating What You Heard

When asking for clarification, repeat the word or phrase you didn't understand:

- That you're paying attention

### Checking Single Syllables

When confirming names or unclear syllables, use the Japanese syllabary system:
- 「あいうえお、の『い』ですか」(Is it "i" from a-i-u-e-o?)

## Words from this Dialogue

### 誰マター (dare-mataa) - who's in charge?

Japanese often borrows words from foreign languages, often with little consideration for the original pronunciation or spelling. This can be a challenge for Japanese language learners.

In this case, Japanese「誰」(who) is mixed with English「マター」(matter) to create a new word. Words like this may be used only by certain groups or people in certain industries. Even some Japanese people may not know the meaning at first!

When you aren't certain of the meaning, be sure to ask for clarification.

**Other shortened katakana examples:**
- スマホ (sumaho) ← スマートフォン (smartphone)
- プレゼン (purezen) ← プレゼンテーション (presentation)
- メンテ (mente) ← メンテナンス (maintenance)
- インフラ (infura) ← インフラストラクチャー (infrastructure)
