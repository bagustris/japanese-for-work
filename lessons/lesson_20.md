## Role-play Setup

You are a taxi driver who has been hired to take a passenger to Tokyo Station. The passenger is in a hurry to catch a specific Shinkansen (bullet train) and is anxious about making it on time. While you normally could make it to Tokyo Station in 30 minutes, traffic conditions are unpredictable and you cannot guarantee arrival time. You need to manage the passenger's expectations honestly while being polite and professional, avoiding making promises you cannot keep.

## Full Script & Explanation

### Scene 1: Greeting the Passenger

**Wada (Passenger):**  
運転手さん、予約した和田です。  
*Untenshu-san, yoyaku shita Wada desu.*  
Driver, I'm Wada. I made the booking.

> **Grammar Note:** 「運転手さん」is being used here to call out to the driver. In many situations, you can add「さん」after a profession in this way. Ex.「駅員さん」station worker /「美容師さん」hair stylist /「看護師さん」nurse /「パン屋さん」baker

**Driver:**  
お待ちしておりました。  
*Omachi shite orimashita.*  
I've been waiting for you.

> **Grammar Note:** 「お待ちしておりました」is a polite way of saying「待っていました」. This is not meant to point out that someone was late. Instead, it is meant to say that someone was expected and welcome. It's a form of customer service おもてなし.

### Scene 2: Loading Luggage

**Wada:**  
この荷物、後ろに入れてもらえますか。  
*Kono nimotsu, ushiro ni irete moraemasu ka.*  
Can you put this in the trunk?

> **Grammar Note:** The phrase above omits the particle「を」from the sentence「この荷物を後ろに入れてもらえますか」. In relaxed conversation, particles are often omitted in this way.「～てもらえますか」is used to ask someone to do something politely.

**Driver:**  
お預かりします。  
*Oazukari shimasu.*  
Certainly.

> **Grammar Note:** This is a polite way of saying「荷物を預かります」.

---

### Scene 3: Expressing Urgency

**Wada:**  
あっ、新幹線に間に合うかな。乗ろう！  
*A, shinkansen ni maniau ka na. Norō!*  
Will we make the Shinkansen? Let's go.

> **Grammar Note:** 「あっ」is an expression used when remembering something. In this case, the speaker is recalling that they need to make the Shinkansen, and is worried that they may not make it in time. The form「動詞（辞書形）＋かな」expresses doubt, and is often used in casual conversation.「乗ろう」is a casual form of「乗りましょう」.

**Driver:**  
ドアをお閉めします。ご注意ください。  
*Doa o oshime shimasu. Gochūi kudasai.*  
I'll close the door now. Please be careful.

> **Grammar Note:** 「お閉めします」is a humble form of 閉めます, to close.「ご注意ください」is a respectful form of「注意してください」. Use the following formula:「ご＋名詞（注意）＋ください」. You often hear phrases using this construction on public transport.

### Scene 4: Stating the Requirement

**Wada:**  
１４時の新幹線に乗りたいんです。  
*Jūyo-ji no shinkansen ni noritai n desu.*  
We need to make the 2 PM train.

> **Grammar Note:** 「～んです」is used to add emphasis to the situation. In this case, the situation is:「14時の新幹線に乗りたいです。あまり時間がありませんね。間に合うかな、大丈夫かな。」. In Japan, the 24-hour clock is often used when referring to time, even in conversation.

**Wada:**  
急いで東京駅までお願いします。  
*Isoide Tōkyō-eki made onegai-shimasu.*  
Please hurry to Tokyo Station.

> **Grammar Note:** 「急いで～までお願いします」is a useful phrase that can be used to relay to the driver that one is in a hurry. It means the same thing as「東京駅まで。急いでください。」.

**Driver:**  
かしこまりました。ナビでお調べいたします。  
*Kashikomarimashita. Nabi de oshirabe itashimasu.*  
Certainly. I will check the navigation.

> **Grammar Note:** 「かしこまりました」is a more polite form of「わかりました」. It can be used in business when speaking to a superior, or at a restaurant when speaking to a customer. The「ナビ」in「ナビでお調べいたします」is short for「ナビゲーション」, or GPS system.「お調べいたします」is a polite form of「調べます」. Use the following formula:「お＋調べ（ます形）＋いたします」.

### Scene 5: Asking About Time

**Wada:**  
大丈夫ですか。あと３０分で行けますか。  
*Daijōbu desu ka. Ato sanjuppun de ikemasu ka.*  
Will we make it? Can we get there in 30 minutes?

> **Grammar Note:** 「行けます」is the potential form of「行きます」.「大丈夫ですか」is being used to ask whether, based on the current situation, they will be able to make it in time.「あと30分で行けますか」is asking whether or not they will make it within 30 minutes.

**Driver:**  
通常は３０分で行けますが、道路事情によって変わります。  
*Tsūjō wa sanjuppun de ikemasu ga, dōro jijō ni yotte kawarimasu.*  
Normally it takes 30 minutes, but it depends on the traffic conditions.

> **Grammar Note:** 「通常は」means the same thing as「いつもは」and「普段は」.「道路事情によって変わります」means that, depending on traffic conditions including congestion, the journey to Tokyo Station may take longer than usual.

---

### Scene 6: Showing Concern

**Wada:**  
えっ、指定席とっているんですけど。  
*E, shiteiseki totte iru n desu kedo.*  
Oh, no! We have reserved tickets.

> **Grammar Note:** 「えっ」is an expression of surprise. Here,「指定席をとっているんですけど」is being used to mean「すでに指定席をとっています。何とかなりませんか」(We've already booked our tickets. Can't you do something?).

## 🔑 KEY PHRASE

**場合によっては間に合わないこともあります。よろしいでしょうか。**  
***Baai ni yotte wa maniawanai koto mo arimasu. Yoroshii deshō ka.***  
**We may not make it in time. Will that be okay?**

> **Explanation:**  
> This phrase is crucial for managing expectations honestly and professionally:
> 1.「場合によっては」- "depending on the situation" (acknowledges variables)
> 2.「間に合わないこともあります」- "there are cases where we won't make it" (honest possibility)
> 3.「よろしいでしょうか」- "is that acceptable?" (asks for understanding)
> 
> 「承知いたしましたが、場合によっては間に合わないこともあります」means: I understand what you are saying. We may make it in time, but there may be things out of my control, like traffic, that will cause us not to make it. It's a polite way of explaining that there is a possibility of not arriving on time. Even in cases where you might think「多分大丈夫」(It's probably okay.) it is better NOT to say「大丈夫です」(It'll be okay.) in Japan. In this case, if the driver says「大丈夫です」and then is not able to make it on time, it may prompt a bad reaction. The passenger may say "But you said we would make it!" and be angry.「大丈夫です」is equivalent to a promise that the driver will definitely make it on time. So be wary of saying「大丈夫です」when you are not 100% certain of something.

### Scene 7: Accepting the Situation

**Wada:**  
まぁ、安全第一だから、仕方ないね。  
*Mā, anzen daiichi dakara, shikata nai ne.*  
Well, safety first. Can't do anything about it, I guess.

> **Grammar Note:** 「安全第一」means safety first. See the Vocabulary section.「仕方ないね」means there is no choice; there are no other options. In this case, the speaker is saying this to reassure both listeners that everything will be okay, and to defuse the situation.

**Colleague:**  
昼ごはんでも食べるか。  
*Hiru-gohan demo taberu ka.*  
Want to have lunch?

> **Grammar Note:** The「でも」in「昼ごはんでも食べるか」is being used to mean the same thing as「例えば」. In the event that they cannot make the train, the speaker is inviting his young coworker to have lunch with him.

**Colleague:**  
そうですね。  
*Sō desu ne.*  
Good idea.

> **Grammar Note:** This phrase expresses agreement.

**Driver:**  
では、出発します。  
*Dewa, shuppatsu shimasu.*  
I'll start driving now.

> **Grammar Note:** 「では」is used to change the topic of conversation. It's a shortened form of「それでは」.

## Cultural Notes

### The Danger of Saying 大丈夫です

In Japanese service culture:
- Saying「大丈夫です」creates a promise or guarantee
- If you can't fulfill it, customers will feel deceived
- It's better to be honest about uncertainty than overpromise
- Use phrases like「場合によっては」to acknowledge variables

This applies in many situations:
- Delivery times
- Project deadlines  
- Service availability
- Travel times

### 安全第一 (Anzen Daiichi) Culture

Japanese work culture emphasizes safety above all:
- Never rush at the expense of safety
- Following safety protocols is more important than speed
- Using「安全第一」shows responsibility
- Customers generally accept safety as a valid reason for delays

### Managing Uncertainty Professionally

Good practices:
1. Acknowledge the request: かしこまりました
2. Provide typical timeframe: 通常は～
3. Note variables: ～によって変わります
4. State possibility of delay: 場合によっては～
5. Ask for understanding: よろしいでしょうか
