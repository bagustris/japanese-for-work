## Vocabulary

### 失礼 (しつれい) - shitsurei - rude, excuse me

「失礼」is a word often used in the business world. 「失礼」means "rude" by definition, but can be used in a variety of different situations to mean different things. In the business scene, 失礼 may be used to make a light and casual apology. For example, apologizing for not knowing how to read someone's name isn't terribly rude, but it may still be perceived negatively.

**Usage examples:**
- 電話で：「失礼ですが、もう一度お名前をいただけますか。」  
  On the phone: Excuse me, could you repeat your name?
- 「もう一度お名前を伺ってもよろしいでしょうか。」  
  Could I ask your name again?
- 「失礼ですが、お名前をもう一度お願いいたします」  
  Excuse me, your name once more, please.
- 帰る時：「お先に失礼いたします」「お先に失礼します」  
  When leaving for the day: I'm leaving for the day.

> **Cultural Note:** 「さようなら」is not used at the workplace.「お先に失礼いたします」is used when you leave before others who are still working.

### 早速 (さっそく) - sassoku - promptly, right away

「早速」is used when an action is being undertaken promptly. The meaning is the same as 「すぐ」, but 早速 has a more formal and proper nuance. When shifting a topic of conversation, 早速 is often used. In business situations, 早速 should be used rather than すぐ.

**Usage examples:**
- 「早速ですが」is used when the main topic of conversation is about to be started. In other words, it means that the introductions and preliminaries are over, and the important information is about to come.
- 「早速ご返信いただきありがとうございます」  
  Thank you for your prompt response.
- 「早速ですが、今月の売上について報告いたします。」  
  Now I'd like to report about this month's sales.
- 「時間に限りがあるので、早速本題に移りたいと思います。」  
  Time is limited, so I'd like to move on to the main topic.

## Cultural Notes

### Business Card Exchange Etiquette

When meeting someone for the first time in a business setting in Japan, exchanging business cards (名刺 - meishi) is a crucial ritual. The proper way to exchange business cards is:

1. Hold your card with both hands, with the text facing the recipient
2. Present it while saying your name and 「どうぞよろしくお願いいたします」
3. Receive their card with both hands
4. Read the card carefully before putting it away
5. If sitting down for a meeting, place the cards on the table in front of you

Never write on someone's business card in front of them, and treat the card with respect as it represents the person.

### Name Reading Challenges

Japanese names are notoriously difficult to read because:
- The same kanji can have multiple readings
- Names may use unusual or archaic readings
- Some names use kanji combinations that don't follow standard patterns

It's always better to ask politely how to read someone's name than to guess incorrectly. Mispronouncing someone's name repeatedly can be seen as disrespectful.

## Grammar Points

### 1. ～と申します (to mooshimasu) - Humble self-introduction

This is the humble form of「～です」used when introducing yourself in formal situations.

**Formation:**
[Name] + と申します

**Examples:**
- 「田中と申します。」- My name is Tanaka.
- 「ABC商事の山田と申します。」- I'm Yamada from ABC Trading.

### 2. お + verb stem + する/になる - Honorific expressions

Adding「お」before the verb stem creates honorific expressions.

**For others' actions (respect):**
- 読む → お読みになる (to read - honorific)
- 待つ → お待ちになる (to wait - honorific)

**For your own actions (humble):**
- 読む → お読みする (to read - humble)
- 待つ → お待たせする (to keep waiting - humble)

### 3. ～でしょうか - Polite question form

Adding「でしょうか」makes questions more polite and softer than using「ですか」.

**Examples:**
- 「これでよろしいでしょうか。」- Will this be all right?
- 「お名前はなんでしょうか。」- What is your name?

## Tips from this Dialogue

1. **Always use 失礼ですが before asking potentially sensitive questions** - This shows awareness that your question might be seen as rude, but you need clarification.

2. **Confirm information by repeating it back** - After learning the correct pronunciation, repeat the name back to confirm you understood correctly.

3. **Use appropriate honorifics with names** - Use 様 (sama) for clients and people of higher status, especially when confirming their names.

4. **Start meetings with proper greetings** - Thank people for their time and for coming, especially if they've traveled to meet you.
