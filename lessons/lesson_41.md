## Full Script & Explanation

### Observing the Situation

**Jooshi / Superior**

田中さん、腰が痛そうだね。  
*Tanaka-san, koshi ga itasoo da ne.*  
Tanaka-san, your back looks like it hurts.

> 「腰」means "lower back" or "waist." Adding「そう」to the i-adjective stem「痛い」creates「痛そう」, meaning "looks painful." [expressing concern]

**Dooryoo / Coworker (Tanaka-san)**

あ、はい。でも、大丈夫です。  
*A, hai. Demo, daijoobu desu.*  
Oh, yes. But I'm fine.

> Tanaka-san downplays her pain, a common response in Japanese work culture to avoid burdening others. [responding]

**Jooshi / Superior**

そう。無理しないでね。  
*Soo. Muri shinaide ne.*  
I see. Don't push yourself.

> 「無理しないで」means "don't overdo it" or "don't push yourself too hard." [expressing concern]

**Dooryoo / Coworker (Tanaka-san)**

はい、ありがとうございます。  
*Hai, arigatoo gozaimasu.*  
Yes, thank you.

### Discussing with a Colleague

**Jooshi / Superior**

ワンさん、田中さんのことなんだけど、どうも腰が痛いらしいんだよね。  
*Wan-san, Tanaka-san no koto nan da kedo, doomo koshi ga itai rashii n da yo ne.*  
Uan-san, about Tanaka-san—it seems her back really hurts.

> 「どうも」here means "apparently" or "it seems." 「らしい」indicates hearsay or appearance. Together they express that something appears to be the case. [giving factual information]

**Student**

そうなんですか。  
*Soo nan desu ka.*  
Is that so?

**Jooshi / Superior**

でも、みんなに迷惑をかけたくないみたいで。  
*Demo, minna ni meewaku o kaketakunai mitai de.*  
But it seems she doesn't want to cause trouble for everyone.

> 「迷惑をかける」means "to cause trouble/inconvenience to someone." This phrase reveals Tanaka-san's mindset—she's prioritizing the team over her own health. [giving factual information]

**Jooshi / Superior**

ワンさんから、あまり無理しないように、言ってあげてくれないかな。  
*Wan-san kara, amari muri shinai yoo ni, itte agete kurenai ka na.*  
Could you tell her, from you, not to push herself too much?

> 「〜から」here means "from (someone)." The superior is asking the student to convey encouragement. 「言ってあげて」means "say (for someone's benefit)." [requesting]

**Student**

はい、分かりました。  
*Hai, wakarimashita.*  
Yes, understood.

### Supporting the Coworker

**Student**

田中さん、お疲れ様でした。  
*Tanaka-san, otsukaresama deshita.*  
Tanaka-san, good work today.

> 「お疲れ様でした」is a standard phrase to acknowledge someone's hard work. [greeting people]

**Dooryoo / Coworker (Tanaka-san)**

あ、お疲れ様です。  
*A, otsukaresama desu.*  
Oh, good work.

### KEY PHRASE

**Student**

きょうの仕事も大変でしたね。お互い、無理はしないように気をつけましょう。  
*Kyoo no shigoto mo taihen deshita ne. Otagai, muri wa shinai yooni ki o tsukemashoo.*  
It was a tough day of work, huh? Let's both be careful not to push ourselves too hard.

> 「も」after「きょうの仕事」implies "today's work too (like other days)." 「お互い」means "both of us" or "mutually," creating a sense of shared experience rather than singling out Tanaka-san.

> 「無理はしないように気をつけましょう」means "let's be careful not to overdo it." By using「しましょう」(let's), the speaker includes themselves, making it feel like mutual encouragement rather than a direct warning. This is a tactful way to show concern. [offering suggestions] [expressing concern]

**Dooryoo / Coworker (Tanaka-san)**

そうですね。ありがとうございます。  
*Soo desu ne. Arigatoo gozaimasu.*  
You're right. Thank you.

> Tanaka-san accepts the encouragement. [expressing gratitude]

## Cultural Notes

### The Challenge of Accepting Help in Japanese Work Culture

Japanese work culture values:
- **我慢** (gaman) - endurance, perseverance
- **チームワーク** (chiimuwaaku) - teamwork, not burdening others
- **責任感** (sekininkan) - sense of responsibility

This can lead workers to:
- Hide pain or illness
- Refuse to take time off
- Work through injuries

### Supporting Colleagues Tactfully

When encouraging a colleague to take it easy:

1. **Use inclusive language:** Say「お互い」(both of us) instead of just addressing them
2. **Make it mutual:** Use「しましょう」(let's) to share the responsibility
3. **Don't single them out:** Avoid making them feel weak or problematic
4. **Acknowledge their dedication:** Recognize their hard work first
5. **Be gentle:** Use suggestions, not orders

This approach respects their dignity while conveying genuine concern.
