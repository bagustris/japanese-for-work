*Inre-ko wa Yangon kara hikooki de yaku ichi-jikan desu.*  
Lake Inle is about one hour from Yangon by plane.

> **Explanation:** This phrase is useful for sharing how much time it takes to reach a destination. You can substitute「電車で」(by train),「車で」(by car),「タクシーで」(by taxi) instead of「飛行機で」to show how to get there by different modes of transportation. For "on foot" use「歩くと」. インレー湖 (Lake Inle) is the name of a lake. The character 湖 can be read as「みずうみ」or「こ」. Examples: 琵琶湖（びわこ - Lake Biwa), 芦ノ湖（あしのこ - Lake Ashi).

**Client (客):**  
あ、１時間ですか。  
*A, ichi-jikan desu ka.*  
Ah, one hour?

> **Explanation:** The listener is checking what the speaker said. Adding「あ」in the beginning shows the listener's reaction to what they have just heard. To express disappointment, a long「あー」with falling intonation is used.

次に、インレー湖の見どころについてご説明します。  
*Tsugi ni, Inre-ko no midokoro ni tsuite goseetsumee shimasu.*  
Next, I'll explain the highlights of Lake Inle.

> **Explanation:** Using phrases like まず and 次に to connect phrases allows the listener to easily follow what is being said.「見どころ」means highlight. It can be used in cases like this, such as explaining the must-see sights at a destination.「見どころ」can also be used to mean "something to look out for" in reference to things like sports or movies.

**Student:**  
ここに住む人たちは湖の上で生活をしています。  
*Koko ni sumu hitotachi wa mizuumi no ue de seekatsu o shite imasu.*  
The people who live here carry out their daily lives on the water.

> **Explanation:**「ここに住む」modifies「人たち」. See the below examples:  
> 「渋谷に来る人たち」→「渋谷に来る」「人たち」(the people who come to Shibuya)  
> 「先に食べる人たち」→「先に食べる」「人たち」(the people who eat first)  
> 「電車で帰る人たち」→「電車で帰る」「人たち」(the people who go home by train)

Over 160,000 tourists visit each year.

> **Explanation:** This is a useful phrase to describe a bustling tourist spot.「訪れます」(visit) uses the present tense to communicate that people regularly visit this spot.  
> For the past tense, use:「昨年は16万人以上の観光客が訪れました」(Last year, 160,000 tourists visited here).  
> To predict the future, use:「１年間に16万人以上の観光客が見込まれます」(It's expected that 160,000 tourists will visit here yearly).

**Client:**  
へえ、そうなんですね。  
*Hee, soo nan desu ne.*

**Client:**  
インレー湖は日本人観光客にも人気が出ますかね。  
*Inre-ko wa Nihon-jin kankookyaku ni mo ninki ga demasu ka ne.*  
Do many Japanese tourists visit Lake Inle?

> **Explanation:** The phrase「人気が出ますかね」, like「人気が出るかな？」shows that the speaker is wondering if this is the case or not. This phrase is more polite than「かな」and gently asks for the listener's agreement. By adding「も」onto「日本人の観光客にも」includes the idea that the spot is already popular with tourists from other countries and regions.

**Student:**  
はい、日本の方も楽しめると思います。  
*Hai, Nihon no kata mo tanoshimeru to omoimasu.*  
Yes, I think Japanese people would really enjoy it.
