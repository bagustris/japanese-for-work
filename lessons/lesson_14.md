## Role-play Setup

## Full Script & Explanation

### Scene 1: Being Asked for a Favor

**Superior:**  
ちょっとお願いがあるんだけど、いいかな。  
*Chotto onegai ga aru n da kedo, ii ka na.*  
Could I ask you a favor?

> **Grammar Note:** Use this phrase when you want to ask a favor of someone. 「いいかな」 is a phrase suitable for use from superiors to subordinates. To be more polite, use 「少しお願いがあるんですが、いいでしょうか（いいですか）」. The 「ちょっと」in「ちょっとお願いがある」may actually mean that it is a small favor, but in some cases, the favor might be a bigger one than expected. Be sure to ask exactly what is required of you when someone asks you for a favor!

**Student:**  
なんですか。  
*Nan desu ka.*  
What is it?

> **Grammar Note:** Use 「なんですか」 only when you have a close relationship with a superior. Using 「でしょうか」 , as in 「なんでしょうか」, gives a softer and more polite impression. To be even more polite, add「はい」 to make 「はい、なんでしょうか」.

### Scene 2: The Request

**Superior:**  
この図面で修正が見つかって、直さなければならないんだよ。  
*Kono zumen de shūsei ga mitsukatte, naosanakereba naranai n da yo.*  
We found some errors in this diagram. It needs to be fixed.

> **Grammar Note:** The diagram needs to be fixed. The 「だよ」 at the end is suitable for use from superiors to subordinates. Saying 「直さなければならないんです」is a more neutral phrase, so it is acceptable for use even from subordinates to superiors.

**Student:**  
そうですか。  
*Sō desu ka.*  
I see.

> **Grammar Note:** The falling intonation here indicates that the speaker is considering the situation.

**Superior:**  
ちょっと修正が多いんだけど、今日の４時までにやってくれるかな。  
*Chotto shūsei ga ōi n da kedo, kyō no yo-ji made ni yatte kureru ka na.*  
There are quite a few corrections. Could you have this done by 4?

> **Grammar Note:** The 「～んだけど」in 「ちょっと修正が多いんだけど」is often used when explaining a situation. Although the speaker is asking「やってくれるかな」, the meaning here is closer to an order, 「やってください」. If you won't be able to do the favor that is asked of you, it's better to let your superior know at this point in the conversation.

### Scene 3: Explaining Your Situation

**Student:**  
あの、実は今、別の仕事を頼まれています。  
*Ano, jitsu wa ima, betsu no shigoto o tanomarete imasu.*  
Actually, I was just asked to do something else.

> **Grammar Note:** When explaining your circumstances, you can use the phrase 「あの、実は・・・」. When the listener hears the phrase, it will let them know that you already have something going on. When consulting with someone, or seeking a favor, it's a good idea to explain your current circumstances. This will help the communication process go more smoothly. In this case, the speaker is about to ask what they should do in this situation, so they are explaining that they have just been asked to do another task. By doing this, the two can decide what course of action to take together.

## 🔑 KEY PHRASE

**あの、実は今、別の仕事を頼まれています。**  
***Ano, jitsu wa ima, betsu no shigoto o tanomarete imasu.***  
**Actually, I was just asked to do something else.**

> **Explanation:**  
> This phrase is essential when you're already busy but someone asks you to do additional work. It:
> 1. Uses「あの」to softly get attention
> 2. Uses「実は」to indicate you're about to explain an important situation
> 3. States the fact that you're already committed to another task
> 
> This isn't refusing the request directly - it's providing information so that together you can decide priorities. In Japanese workplace culture, it's better to explain your situation than to simply say "I can't" or accept more work than you can handle.

### Scene 4: Providing Details

**Superior:**  
それはどんな仕事なの。  
*Sore wa donna shigoto na no.*  
What were you asked to do?

> **Grammar Note:** The superior wants to help their subordinate decide the level of priority for the tasks that the subordinate is working on. In cases like this, be sure to explain your situation thoroughly.

**Student:**  
和田さんから、今日の4時までにこの図面の直しを頼まれました。  
*Wada-san kara, kyō no yo-ji made ni kono zumen no naoshi o tanomaremashita.*  
Wada-san asked me to fix this diagram by 4 today.

> **Grammar Note:** This explanation is good because it covers three main points: who asked you to do what task, by when. If you'd like to use a verb, replacing 「図面の直し」with「図面を直す」, then use 「ように」to make 「図面を直すように」.

---

### Scene 5: Asking for Priority Guidance

**Student:**  
どちらを先にすればよろしいでしょうか。  
*Dochira o saki ni sureba yoroshii deshō ka.*  
Which should I do first?

> **Grammar Note:** This is a polite way to ask which task to prioritize. The phrase 「どちらが先ですか」is simple, but may come across as a bit too direct or blunt. Don't just use this phrase on its own. Use it with 「実は、今、別の仕事を頼まれているんです」to explain your current situation first.

**Superior:**  
そうか。じゃあ、これは別の人に頼んでみるよ。  
*Sō ka. Jaa, kore wa betsu no hito ni tanonde miru yo.*  
I see. In that case, I'll ask someone else.

> **Grammar Note:** In this case, the superior has understood the situation and decided to ask someone else to take care of the task they need taken care of. For a superior talking to a subordinate, this phrase is acceptable. To be more polite, use 「そうですか。では、これは別の人に頼んでみます。」.

**Student:**  
すみません。よろしくお願いします。  
*Sumimasen. Yoroshiku onegai-shimasu.*  
Sorry about that. Thank you.

> **Grammar Note:** Saying 「すみません」here instead of simply 「はい、よろしくお願いします」adds the nuance that you are sorry that you couldn't help them out. It creates a favorable impression.

## Vocabulary

### 修正 (しゅうせい) - shūsei - corrections

In the case of diagrams, you can use the words 「修正」or 「直し」 interchangeably. 「修正」has a slightly more formal nuance. 「直し」 gives the impression that there are not too many corrections to be made, whereas「修正」 may imply a greater number of corrections. However, this can vary case by case, so be sure to ask exactly how much is required of you with 「どのぐらいの量でしょうか」.

**Usage examples:**
- 図面の修正 - corrections to a diagram
- 大幅な修正 - large-scale corrections
- 修正点 - a point to correct
- 修正作業 - correcting
- 修正をする - to correct
- 修正を行う - to carry out corrections
- 間違いを修正する - to correct a mistake

### 実は (じつは) - jitsu wa - Actually...

This phrase is used before explaining important information to a listener. It's a useful signal to let the listener know that they are about to hear an explanation. Be sure not to overuse this phrase.

**Usage examples:**
- 「実は来月、妹の結婚式があり、一時帰国を考えています。4日間休みをとってもいいでしょうか。」（部下から上司へ）  
  From a subordinate to a superior: Actually, next month my sister is getting married, so I'm planning on making a visit back home. May I take four days off?
- 「実はこの間話した出張の件だけど、日程が変更になりそうなんだ。」（上司から部下へ）  
  From a superior to a subordinate: Actually, it's about the business trip I told you about recently. It seems like the date of the trip is going to change.

## Cultural Notes

### Managing Multiple Requests in Japanese Workplaces

In Japanese work culture, it's important to:
- Not overcommit to tasks you cannot complete
- Communicate honestly about your workload
- Provide specific details when explaining conflicts
- Let superiors make the final decision on priorities
- Show appreciation even when you can't help

The phrase「実は」signals that you're about to explain a difficult situation, preparing the listener to understand your position.

### The Art of Saying No Indirectly

Japanese workplace communication often avoids direct refusals. Instead of saying "No, I can't," workers explain their situation and ask for guidance. This approach:
- Maintains harmony (和 - wa)
- Shows respect for the requester
- Allows for collaborative problem-solving
- Demonstrates responsibility and honesty
