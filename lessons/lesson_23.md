## Full Script & Explanation

### Discovering the Misunderstanding

**Colleague (Bima's Coworker)**

ビマさん、EJの仕事はどうなりました？  
*Bima-san, EJ no shigoto wa dō narimashita?*  
Bima-san, how's that EJ job?

> The phrase「仕事はどうなりました？」is often used to check on the status of a job. In this case, the「か」 of「～はどうなりましたか」is omitted.
> You can use a number of terms in the place of「EJの仕事」, such as 「例の件」or「あのプロジェクト」.

**Bima (Protagonist)**

今から取り掛かるところです。  
*Ima kara torikakaru tokoro desu.*  
I'm about to get started.

> This phrase means「これから仕事を始める」. The phrase「ところです」lets the listener know where you are in the process of 仕事に取り掛かる→仕事をしている→仕事が終わった.

**Colleague**

えっ、今から？ EJですよ？  
*E, ima kara? EJ desu yo?*  
About to start? On EJ?

> The phrase「えっ、今から？」shows surprise. The speaker is shocked that the work hasn't been started on a product that was due this afternoon. The phrase「EJですよ？」is used to confirm that the speaker and listener are talking about the same thing.

**Colleague**

今日のお昼が納品でしたよね。  
*Kyō no ohiru ga nōhin deshita yo ne.*  
That work was due this afternoon, right?

> The speaker is confirming the due date. The phrase「よね」is often used when making a confirmation.

**Bima**

そうなんですか？  
*Sō nan desu ka?*  
Really?

> The speaker is surprised, and asks this question. The intonation is rising in this case. But by changing the intonation, this phrase can be used to indicate surprise, doubt, satisfaction, or confirmation.

**Bima**

その指示書を見せてくれますか。  
*Sono shijisho o misete kuremasu ka.*  
Can you show me the instructions?

> The speaker is asking to see the instructions. The phrase「見せてください」is a direct order. Using the phrase 「見せてくれますか」is a request.

**Bima**

これはEJ自動車の仕事ですね。  
*Kore wa EJ Jidōsha no shigoto desu ne.*  
This is EJ Automotive.

> The initials of the company, EJ, caused the confusion. There are two companies with the same initials that requested products! The sentence explains the facts as the speaker attempts to remain calm.

**Colleague**

あった、ほら、こっちですよ。EJ工業の仕事ですよ。  
*Atta, hora, kotchi desu yo. EJ Kōgyō no shigoto desu yo.*  
Here it is, look. This one. This is the EJ Manufacturing job.

> When you find something, use 「あった」rather than 「ある」. 「ほら」means「ほら（みてください）」, and is a request for the listener to look. The phrase「こっちですよ」shows that this is the order form from EJ Manufacturing, and not EJ Automotive.

**Bima**

私もちゃんと確認すればよかったですね。  
*Watashi mo chanto kakunin sureba yokatta desu ne.*  
But I should have checked, too. Not just you.

> The form「～ばよかった」shows regret at having not done something. The speaker feels responsibility for not communicating thoroughly enough.

**Bima**

取り急ぎ、先方に説明してきますね。  
*Toriisogi, senpō ni setsumei shite kimasu ne.*  
I'll explain to the client.

> When a problem occurs, it's important to take the necessary actions right away. The phrase「取り急ぎ」means「まずは、すぐに」. In this case, the speaker is using it to show that there are lots of actions that must be taken. The word「先方」refers to the client, EJ Manufacturing. The speaker will now let them know about the problem.

**Colleague**

お願いします。  
*Onegai shimasu.*  
Thank you.

> The speaker is asking their coworker to please do what they suggested.

### Dealing with the Client Call

**Department Manager**

ビマさん、EJ工業から催促の電話が来てるけど、終わったよね。  
*Bima-san, EJ Kōgyō kara saisoku no denwa ga kiteru kedo, owatta yo ne.*  
I got a call from EJ Manufacturing. That job is done, right?

> The speaker got a call from EJ Manufacturing asking about their products. The speaker is asking the listener to confirm that they successfully delivered the products.

**Bima**

すみません、実はまだ終わっていません。  
*Sumimasen, jitsu wa mada owatte imasen.*  
I'm sorry. Actually, it's not done yet.

> The speaker begins with 「すみません」before apologizing that the work hasn't been finished yet. The phrase「実は」precedes an explanation.

**Department Manager**

あれ、お昼過ぎているよ。  
*Are, ohiru sugite iru yo.*  
But it's already past noon.

> The product was supposed to be delivered by noon, so the speaker reacts with surprise by using the phrase 「あれ、」. By stating the facts as he understands them, the speaker is asking for more details.

**Department Manager**

営業の岩村さんと納期の確認はしなかったの？  
*Eigyō no Iwamura-san to nōki no kakunin wa shinakatta no?*  
You didn't check the deadline with Iwamura-san from sales?

> The speaker is asking if the listener confirmed the deadline with his coworker ahead of time. By asking using「しなかったの？」, the speaker shows that he expected the listener to have checked.

### KEY PHRASE

**Bima**

すみません、行き違いがあったようです。すぐに対応いたします。  
*Sumimasen, ikichigai ga atta yō desu. Sugu ni taiō itashimasu.*  
There's been a misunderstanding. I'll deal with it right away.

> These two sentences contain an explanation, a reason for the problem, and how the speaker plans to deal with the problem. The word「すみません」is used to begin, and is an apology for the missed deadline. Next, the speaker explains that the problem stemmed from a lack of communication between himself and his coworker. But, he avoids placing blame on either party. Next, the speaker uses the phrase 「ようです」to show that there are still parts of the situation that are unclear. These two sentences let the listener know that since the client is waiting, there is no time for a lengthy explanation, and that the speaker must deal with the situation right away.
> When problems occur, it's important to work as a team to resolve the issues quickly. It's also important to take steps to make sure that the same mistake doesn't happen again.

**Department Manager**

じゃあ、よろしくね。  
*Jā, yoroshiku ne.*  
Okay, thank you.

> The speaker's comment indicates that even though the details aren't clear yet, solving the problem is the most important step to take, so he would like the listener to take care of it.

## Vocabulary

**取り掛かる** (torikakaru) - get to work, get started  
「取り掛かる」means to get started or get to work on something. The action hasn't started yet. The word「取り組む」is similar, but「取り組む」means「（仕事や問題の解決などに向けて）熱心に励むこと」(putting effort in to see that a task is finished or a problem is solved) and indicates that action is already taking place.  
Example: 3か月間プログラム開発に取り組んだ。(I took on a 3-month program development job.)  
Example: プロジェクトが終わり、ようやく次の仕事に取り掛かることができる。(The project finished, so I can get started on my next task.)  
Example: システムが復旧してやっと仕事に取り掛かることができた。(The system is back online, so I was able to get to work.)  
Example: バグの原因を解明するために調査に取り掛かる。(I'm about to get started on an investigation into what caused the bug.)

**納品** (nōhin) - fulfillment, submission, delivery  
納品 means to fulfill an order or deliver a product that was ordered. This word can be used in phrases like「納品管理」and「納品先」. For example, combine 納品 and 予定日 to make 納品予定日. Combine 納品 and 方法 to make 納品方法. 納品 can be used to refer to both products and services.  
Example: 納品管理 (delivery management)  
Example: 納品書 (delivery slip)  
Example: 日本の会社は納品日に厳しい。(Japanese companies are strict in their product delivery deadlines.)  
Example: この製品は受注から納品まで２週間かかる。(This product has a two-week lead time between order and delivery.)  
Example: 納品予定日は10月10日です。(The scheduled delivery date is October 10th.)

**取り急ぎ** (toriisogi) - for now  
In this skit,「取り急ぎ」means「やらなければならないことは色々あるが、まずは」(I'm quite busy, so for now, I'll just do this.). It's used in many situations. For example, when writing an email, you can use the phrase「取り急ぎお知らせします」to let the recipient know something, even if you are in a hurry. This phrase lets the recipient know that you will follow up later. However, if considerable time has passed, or you would rather be polite, try not to use 「取り急ぎ」.  
Example: 取り急ぎ見積書を添付いたします。詳細につきましては後ほどご説明いたします。(For now, I'll send the quotation. I'll follow up later with a more detailed explanation.)  
Example: ～さんから電話があり、取り急ぎ用件をメールで送るということです。(I had a call from Ms. ~, who let me know that she would send you a quick email for now.)
