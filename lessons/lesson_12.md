Asking for clarification
すみません、確認させてください。
Please let me confirm.
戻りました。 I&apos;m back.
After returning to your desk from being out (for instance, at a client&apos;s place of work, at another branch, or at the factory), say 「戻りました」.
あ、ビノドくん！ちょうど良かった。
Oh, Binod-kun! Perfect timing.
「ちょうど良かった」 is being said because Binod-kun came back at the perfect time to help out!
いま急ぎでお客様の資料をまとめているところなんだ。
We&apos;re gathering some documents for the client. We&apos;re in a hurry.
お客様の資料をまとめている(gathering some documents for the client), in this case, means お客様に渡す資料をまとめている (gathering some documents to give to the client).
「～るところ」means that one is doing something now. 「（ところ）なんだ」is a phrase used to explain to another person what one is doing now. It&apos;s often used as a spoken phrase from superiors to subordinates. For subordinates speaking to superiors, use 「～ところなんです」
ちょっと手伝ってくれないかな。Could you help us out?
To casually ask someone to help, you can use 「ちょっと手伝って」「ちょっと手伝ってくれない」「ちょっと手伝ってくれないか」or「ちょっと手伝ってくれないかな」. When 「かな」is added to the end, it gives a more gentle impression. It also has the nuance that it would really be appreciated if you helped out.
はい、わかりました。Yes, of course.
This indicates that the speaker will help.
できた！お疲れ様です。
We finished! Thank you very much.
「できた！」is used to show that the task is finished. Because it is in casual form, we can assume that the speaker is talking to themself and their coworker. When speaking to a superior, use 「できました！」. You can also use this phrase to report to a superior once you have finished a task.
ビノドさん、僕と課長はこの資料を届けてくるね。
Binod-san, Kacho and I are going to hand over these documents now.
「僕」is a first-person pronoun generally used by men. In the workplace, both men and women often use「私」. 「僕」is often not used when speaking to clients.「届けてくるね」and「届けてきますね」are both casual expressions. Because of the vocabulary used, we can assume that the distance between this company and the client&apos;s company isn&apos;t far.
わかりました。Understood.
ぼくはこれで「直帰」、和田くんはあした、お客様のところへ「直行」するね。
We&apos;ll be leaving now, and I&apos;ll head home right after. Wada-kun will go straight to the client&apos;s office tomorrow.
直帰 means「出先から会社に戻らずそのまま帰る」(heading straight home without returning to the office). 直行 means「自宅からお客さんのところに直接行く」(heading straight to the client&apos;s office from one&apos;s home). These are very frequently used phrases, especially in their kanji forms.
ホワイトボードに貼っておいて。
Could you put that on the whiteboard?
The 「～ておいて」of「貼っておいて」means &quot;to put or leave something in a condition.&quot; In this case, はってください (please stick it) on its own would be okay. However, 「はっておいて」adds the nuance of &quot;stick it, and then leave it in that condition.&quot;
In other words, keep the magnets labeled 「直帰」and「直行」up on the whiteboard so that other employees know where Kachoo and Wada-san are.
すみません、確認させてください。
Please let me confirm.
When you are unclear about what has been asked of you, it&apos;s important to clarify. However, it&apos;s also important not to take up too much of your superior&apos;s time. In cases like this, use 「確認させてください」to ask for permission to ask further questions.
Kan
ji: 確「かく」、確定「かくてい」 finalize, 正確 「せいかく」
accurate,
確認
「かくにん」
直帰はこれ、直行はこれでいいですね。
This is chokki, and this is chokkoo, right?
The speaker is checking that the first magnet is「直帰」and the second magnet is「直行」.
そうそう。じゃあ行ってくるね。 Right. We&apos;ll be leaving now.
「そうそう」is a casual form of 「そうです」.「じゃあ、行ってくるね」is a casual form of 「それでは行ってきます」. Both of these phrases are suitable for a superior talking to a subordinate, but not for a subordinate talking to a superior.
よろしくね。また明日。Thanks. See you tomorrow.
In this case,「よろしくね」is used with the nuance of &quot;Since we&apos;re leaving now, you handle the rest.&quot; 「また明日」is being used because since Kachoo is headed home, he won&apos;t return until tomorrow.

Some Japanese companies are quite picky about the documents that they make. Even for internal documents only, the layout and appearance is important. To this end, many companies have worked out strategies in order to make these documents more efficiently.
