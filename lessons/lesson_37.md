## Full Script & Explanation

### Opening - The Client's Request

**Okyakusama / Client**

漏水の修理についてなんですが、費用は大体どのくらいでしょうか。  
*Roosui no shuuri ni tsuite nan desu ga, hiyoo wa daitai dono kurai deshoo ka.*  
About the repairs for the water leak—about how much will it cost?

> 「漏水」means "water leakage." 「費用」means "cost" or "expense." The client is asking for a cost estimate. [asking for information]

**Student**

そうですね。おおよそ10万円前後かと思います。  
*Soo desu ne. Ooyoso juuman-en zengo ka to omoimasu.*  
Well, I'd say roughly around 100,000 yen.

> 「おおよそ」means "approximately" or "roughly." 「前後」means "more or less" or "around." Together with「おおよそ」and「前後」, the speaker is giving a very approximate estimate. 「かと思います」is a softer way of expressing opinion than「と思います」. [giving factual information]

**Okyakusama / Client**

そうですか。実は、他の業者にも見積もりを頼んでいるんです。  
*Soo desu ka. Jitsu wa, hoka no gyoosha ni mo mitsumori o tanonde iru n desu.*  
I see. Actually, I've asked other companies for estimates too.

> 「業者」means "contractor" or "company" (in this context, renovation companies). 「見積もり」means "estimate" or "quotation." The client is letting the speaker know they're comparing multiple estimates. [giving factual information]

**Okyakusama / Client**

もし今すぐ御社に決めたら、少しでも安くなりませんか。  
*Moshi ima sugu onsha ni kimetara, sukoshi demo yasuku narimasen ka.*  
If I decide on your company right now, couldn't you make it a little cheaper?

> 「御社」is a respectful way to refer to someone else's company. 「今すぐ決めたら」uses the conditional form to say "if I decide right now." The client is asking for a discount in exchange for making an immediate decision. [asking for confirmation]

### KEY PHRASE

**Student**

申し訳ございません。その場では判断できかねるのですが、上司に確認して折り返しお電話いたします。  
*Mooshiwake gozaimasen. Sono ba dewa handan dekikaneru no desu ga, jooshi ni kakunin-shite orikaeshi odenwa itashimasu.*  
I'm very sorry. I'm unable to make that decision on the spot. I'll check with my supervisor and call you back.

> 「その場では」means "on the spot" or "right then and there." 「判断できかねる」is a polite way of saying "I'm unable to judge/decide." The pattern「〜かねる」means "to be unable to" or "to find it difficult to" and is more polite than「できない」.

> By saying「上司に確認して」, the speaker explains that they need to check with their supervisor. 「折り返しお電話いたします」means "I'll call you back." This entire phrase maintains politeness while clearly explaining the process. [offering an apology] [expressing intention]

**Okyakusama / Client**

あぁ、そうですか。じゃあ、お願いします。  
*Aa, soo desu ka. Jaa, onegai-shimasu.*  
Oh, I see. All right, please do.

> The client accepts the explanation and agrees to wait for the callback. [expressing agreement]

### Consultation with Supervisor

**Student**

あの、部長。先ほどお客様から、今すぐ決めるから安くしてほしいと言われたんですが…。  
*Ano, buchoo. Sakihodo okyakusama kara, ima sugu kimeru kara yasuku-shite hoshii to iwareta n desu ga...*  
Um, Manager. A little while ago, a customer said they'd decide right now if we could make it cheaper...

> 「先ほど」means "a little while ago" or "earlier." The speaker is reporting what the client said. The trailing「が」indicates there's an implied question or request for guidance. [giving factual information]

**Jooshi / Superior**

うーん。そのお客様の住所は？  
*Uun. Sono okyakusama no juusho wa?*  
Hmm. Where does the customer live?

> The supervisor wants more information before making a decision. [asking for information]

**Student**

○○市です。  
*○○-shi desu.*  
○○ City.

> The student provides the location information. [giving factual information]

**Jooshi / Superior**

その辺は、営業範囲外だからなぁ…。今回は諦めた方がいいかもしれないね。  
*Sono hen wa, eeegyoo hani-gai dakara naa... Konkai wa akirameta hoo ga ii kamoshirenai ne.*  
That area is outside our service range... We might be better off giving up on this one.

> 「営業範囲外」means "outside the business/service area." 「諦めた方がいい」means "it's better to give up." The supervisor is suggesting they shouldn't pursue this client. [offering suggestions]

**Student**

分かりました。  
*Wakarimashita.*  
Understood.

## Cultural Notes

### Decision-Making Authority in Japanese Companies

In Japanese business culture, individual employees rarely have the authority to make major decisions independently. This is part of the 「稟議制度」(ringi seido) system, where decisions require consultation and approval from superiors.

When you can't make a decision on your own:
1. **Explain clearly** that you lack the authority
2. **Show respect** for the process ("I need to check with my supervisor")
3. **Provide a timeline** for when you'll follow up
4. **Never make promises** you can't keep

### The Phrase「〜かねる」

「かねる」is attached to the stem of verbs to express polite inability or reluctance:
- 判断できかねる (unable to judge)
- お答えしかねる (unable to answer)
- 対応しかねる (unable to handle/deal with)

This is more polite and professional than simply saying「できません」.

---

## Grammar Points

### Using「〜かねる」to Express Polite Inability

**Pattern:** [Verb stem] + かねる

This pattern means "to be unable to" or "to find it difficult to" and is much more polite than「できない」.

**Examples:**
- お答えしかねます。  
  (I'm unable to answer that.)
  
- 対応しかねます。  
  (We're unable to handle that.)
  
- 承諾しかねます。  
  (I'm unable to consent.)

### The Pattern「〜た方がいい」for Suggestions

「方がいい」after the past tense means "it would be better to ~."

**Examples:**
- 早く帰った方がいいです。  
  (You should go home early. / It would be better if you went home early.)
  
- 医者に行った方がいいですよ。  
  (You should see a doctor.)
  
- 確認した方がいいかもしれません。  
  (It might be better to confirm.)

### Using「かもしれない」to Express Possibility

「かもしれない」means "might" or "perhaps."

**Examples:**
- 雨が降るかもしれません。  
  (It might rain.)
  
- 間違っているかもしれない。  
  (I might be wrong.)
  
- 遅れるかもしれないので、先に行ってください。  
  (I might be late, so please go ahead.)
