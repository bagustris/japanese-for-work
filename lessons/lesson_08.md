### Full Script & Explanation

#### 1. どうですか。進んでいますか。
**Doo desu ka. Susunde imasu ka.**  
*Everything going okay?*

- Here, this phrase is being used to check progress. 「進んでいますか」is used here to mean 「仕事は進んでいますか」(How is work going?). In this case, since both the speaker and listener know the situation, there is no need to say「仕事は」.

#### 2. はい、お客様。もう終わりそうです。
**Hai, okyakusama. Moo owarisoo desu.**  
*Yes, ma'am. I'm nearly finished.*

- The speaker is responding politely. 「もう終わりそうです」means "nearly finished, but not finished yet."
- 「終わりそう」uses the verb 終わる and そうです as follows:  
  終わり<ます> ＋ そうです → 終わりそうです。
- This form can be used with other verbs as well:  
  動詞 <ます形のstem> + そうです
- Examples:
  - この仕事はあと30分で終わりそうです → I'll finish this task in half an hour.
  - この店はもうすぐ閉まりそうです (閉まります + そうです) → This store is about to close.

#### 3. あら、いつも早くて助かるわ。ありがとう。
**Ara, itsumo hayakute tasukaru wa. Arigatoo.**  
*You're always so fast! Thank you.*

- 「あら、」is an expression of mild surprise, often used by more elderly women.
- The 「わ」in「早くて助かるわ」is a feminine way to end a sentence.
- Men may tend to use the following expression instead:「あ、いつも早くて助かるよ。ありがとう」

#### 4. どういたしまして。
**Doo itashimashite.**  
*You're welcome.*

- This is a response to 「ありがとう」. It's a comparatively friendly response.
- To be more polite, use a humble phrase like 「いえいえ、そんなことありません」.

#### 5. あそこに戻さないと。
**Asoko ni modosanai to.**  
*I'd better put it back over there.*

- 「戻さないと」is a shortened form of「戻さないといけません」. In this case, the speaker is talking to herself.

#### 6. あっ！痛たたたたた。腰が。
**Ah! Itatatatata. Koshi ga.**  
*Ah! Ow-ow-ow! My back!*

- This is an expression used when you've suddenly hurt yourself.
- 「あっ！」is an expression of surprise.
- 「いたたたた」is used to mean "ouch."
- You can use this phrase for any part of your body, not just your back.

#### 7. 大丈夫ですか。
**Daijoobu desu ka.**  
*Are you alright?*

- This phrase is often used to express concern.

#### 8. よろしければ、私が致しましょうか。
**Yoroshikereba, watashi ga itashimashoo ka.**  
*If you don't mind, shall I do that?*

- This phrase is being used to make a polite offer of help. In this form, the phrase is appropriate for use with superiors or clients.
- To be more casual, use the following:「よければ、私がしましょうか。」or「よければ、私がしようか」.
- In the workplace, it's important to quickly make offers of help when you think help may be needed. If you see someone in need, try using this phrase to offer help!

#### 9. あぁ、お願いします。
**Aa, onegai shimasu.**  
*Oh, thank you.*

- Here,「あぁ」has a nuance of「いいですか。」. This is a casual expression.

#### 10. この本の片付けも、よろしければ、私が致しましょうか。
**Kono hon no katazuke mo, yoroshikereba, watashi ga itashimashoo ka.**  
*Shall I tidy up these books, too?*

#### 11. お願いします。ありがとう。
**Onegai shimasu. Arigatoo.**  
*Yes, please. Thank you.*

#### Key Term: お客様 (おきゃくさま / okyakusama) - Customer/Client

「お客様」and「お客さん」are both words used to mean "customer" or "client."

- **お客様 (okyakusama)** is more formal, and is used by people in the service industry, when directly speaking with a customer.

- **お客さん (okyakusan)** is used in more friendly situations, such as when the customer is someone you have seen before. It may be more commonly used at small businesses and retail shops.

- **顧客 (kokyaku)** is another word for "customer" or "client," but is not used when speaking directly to a customer.

**Examples:**

魚屋（さかなや）で「お客さん、今日はいい魚があるよ。まぐろがいいよ。」  
*At a fish shop: Sir, today we've got great fish. Especially the maguro!*

ホテルのフロントで「お客様、パスポートをお預かりします（おあずかりします）。」  
*In a hotel lobby: Ma'am, may I please see your passport?*

*Please prepare a client list.*

### Cultural Notes

**Offering Help in Japanese Service Culture**

Japanese service culture (おもてなし - omotenashi) emphasizes anticipating needs before being asked. Key points:

1. **Proactive assistance**: Don't wait to be asked—offer help when you see someone struggling
2. **Use humble language**: 致す (itasu) instead of する (suru) when offering to do something for a client
3. **Conditional phrasing**: よろしければ softens the offer and gives the person an easy way to decline
4. **Repeat offers**: The cleaner offers to help twice—first with the item, then with tidying books
5. **Gender differences in speech**: Notice how the elderly female client uses feminine speech patterns (「あら」,「わ」)

**Reading the Situation**

This dialogue demonstrates the importance of:
- Observing clients/customers carefully
- Responding quickly when someone is in pain or distress
- Offering additional help once initial assistance is accepted
