## Role-play Setup

You work for a company that has just received an urgent order, but you don't have enough materials to fulfill it. You need to call your supplier and ask them to move up a delivery date significantly - from next month to the end of this month. This is a difficult request that may cause problems for them, so you must be extremely polite, explain your situation clearly, and use persuasive language even when they express reluctance.

## Full Script & Explanation

### Scene 1: Answering the Phone

**Wada (answering):**  
はい、EJ商事です。  
*Hai, EJ Shōji desu.*  
Hello, this is EJ Trading.

> **Grammar Note:** When answering the phone, be sure to clearly state the name of your company and your department. In the business world,「もしもし」is not used. To be more polite, use「でございます」rather than「です」.

**Liu (caller):**  
大変お世話になっております。  
*Taihen osewa ni natte orimasu.*  
Thank you very much, as always.

> **Grammar Note:** When interacting with suppliers or clients over the phone, greeting with「お世話になっております」is customary. It is used to mean「いつもありがとうございます」.

---

### Scene 2: Asking for the Person

**Liu:**  
Ｋ＆Ｌ社の劉と申しますが、和田様はいらっしゃいますでしょうか。  
*K ando L sha no Ryū to mōshimasu ga, Wada-sama wa irasshaimasu deshō ka.*  
This is Liu with K&L Company. Is Wada-sama there?

> **Grammar Note:** When making a call, be sure to state your company and your own name first. Then, ask for the person you would like to speak to, adding「～様」onto the end of their name.「～さん」may also be acceptable in some cases, but for someone you don't know well, it may not be sufficiently polite.「いらっしゃいますでしょうか」is a more polite way to ask「いますか」.

**Wada:**  
ああ、劉さん。和田です。  
*Aa, Ryū-san. Wada desu.*  
Oh, Liu-san. This is Wada.

> **Grammar Note:** When taking a call, use「はい、◯◯です」to let the caller know that you have answered.「◯◯でございます」is even more polite. From the context of this interaction, we can conclude that Wada-san and Liu-san know each other fairly well.

---

### Scene 3: Introducing the Request

**Liu:**  
和田さんですか。あの、実は一つお願いがあるんですが。  
*Wada-san desu ka. Ano, jitsu wa hitotsu onegai ga aru n desu ga.*  
Oh, Wada-san. I have a favor that I need to ask of you.

> **Grammar Note:** Once you have confirmed who you are speaking with, it's time to get down to business.「あの、実は」is often used to precede asking a favor or bringing up a new or unpleasant subject.「あの」is not necessary, but it adds a buffer and shows more consideration.

**Wada:**  
はい、何でしょうか。  
*Hai, nan deshō ka.*  
Sure, what is it?

> **Grammar Note:** 「何でしょうか」is used to politely and briefly ask what the listener needs from you.「何ですか」is a little too abrupt. Since we can't see the face of the person we speak with on the phone, it is better to be more polite when in doubt.

---

### Scene 4: Making the Request

**Liu:**  
先日発注した材料の件なんですが、納期を早めていただけないでしょうか。  
*Senjitsu hacchū shita zairyō no ken na n desu ga, nōki o hayamete itadakenaideしょう ka.*  
It's about the materials I ordered the other day. Would it be possible to move up the delivery date?

> **Grammar Note:** 「～A～の件なんですが、～B～ていただけませんか」is a formula for politely asking favors. Just add the topic you'd like to discuss in A, and B the specific request you have of the listener. By changing「～ませんか」to「～ないでしょうか」, you can make this phrase more polite. Using a formula like this makes it easy to clarify what specific topic and task you are referring to.

**Wada:**  
納期は来月の15日でしたよね。  
*Nōki wa raigetsu no jūgo-nichi deshita yo ne.*  
The delivery was scheduled for the 15th of next month, right?

> **Grammar Note:** The speaker is clarifying something that both the speaker and listener already know (the delivery date). Adding「よね」at the end of the sentence is common in situations like this.

---

### Scene 5: Specifying the Change

**Liu:**  
はい。それを、今月末にしていただけませんか。  
*Hai. Sore o, kongetsu-matsu ni shite itadakemasen ka.*  
Yes. I was wondering if it could be moved up to the end of this month.

> **Grammar Note:** The speaker is using「それ」to refer to the topic at hand. By putting「それを」at the beginning of the sentence, it creates greater emphasis.「来月15日の納期を今月末にする」is using the formula「AをBにする」to mean "change A to B." Changing delivery dates is often difficult, and may cause problems for business associates, so it is better to be polite and use「～ていただけませんか」in cases like these.

**Wada:**  
今月末ですか。それはちょっと…。  
*Kongetsu-matsu desu ka. Sore wa chotto...*  
The end of this month? Hm, that's a bit...

> **Grammar Note:** 「今月末ですか」is being used to repeat the last point back to the listener. It is also being used to show surprise.「それはちょっと…」is used to mean that something is difficult or likely impossible to do. With business associates, it is important to be polite, so avoid using too-direct phrases like「できません」.

---

### Scene 6: Explaining the Situation

**Liu:**  
実は急な発注があって、材料が足りなくなりそうなんです。  
*Jitsu wa kyū na hacchū ga atte, zairyō ga tarinaku nari-sō na n desu.*  
Well, we've just gotten in a sudden order. Our supplies of the material are about to run out.

> **Grammar Note:** The speaker is explaining why a big request like this had to be made.「実は」is sometimes used to ask for favors, or when beginning a difficult conversation. When you use「実は」, the listener understands that some special circumstances may prevail.「そうなんです」is a combination of「そう（です）＋～なんです」, and is used to report on the condition of something. Using「（な）んです」is a way to ask for the listener's kind understanding.

**Wada:**  
そうですか... 難しいと思うんですよ。  
*Sō desu ka... Muzukashii to omou n desu yo.*  
I see... but I still think it's probably not possible.

> **Grammar Note:** 「そうですか」shows that the speaker understands the situation. By using「難しい」, the speaker lets the listener know that it will be incredibly difficult and likely impossible to accommodate their request.「～んですよ」is used to ask for the listener's understanding.

## 🔑 KEY PHRASE

**そこを何とか、ご検討いただけませんでしょうか。**  
***Soko o nantoka, gokentō itadakemasen deshō ka.***  
**Could you please reconsider?**

> **Explanation:**  
> This is a critical phrase for difficult negotiations. It acknowledges the other party's difficult position while still asking them to reconsider:
> 1.「そこを」- "that point" (acknowledging their difficulty)
> 2.「何とか」- "somehow" (asking them to find a way)
> 3.「ご検討いただけませんでしょうか」- ultra-polite request for reconsideration
> 
> Phrases like「そこを何とか、ご検討いただけませんか」and「何とか、お願いできませんか」are used during difficult negotiations.「そこを何とか」is used to show that you understand the listener's difficult position, but that you must ask for their reconsideration in spite of that. This phrase is more persuasive than a simple request because it shows empathy while persisting.

---

### Scene 7: Agreement to Consider

**Wada:**  
じゃあ、社内で一度相談してみます。  
*Jaa, shanai de ichido sōdan shite mimasu.*  
In that case, we will consider it internally.

> **Grammar Note:** 「じゃあ」is a more casual way of saying「では」. The「～てみます」in「相談してみます」shows that the speaker will give something a try.「相談してみます」means that the speaker will try to move up the delivery date, but there is no guarantee that they will be successful. Rather than making an on-the-spot decision, considering internally means that a final decision can be made later.

**Liu:**  
ありがとうございます。ご連絡お待ちしております。  
*Arigatō gozaimasu. Gorenraku omachi shite orimasu.*  
Thank you. I'll wait to hear from you.

> **Grammar Note:** It's important for the speaker to thank the listener, as a big request was made.「ご連絡お待ちしております」is a more formal way to say「連絡を待っています」.

## Vocabulary

### 納期 (のうき) - nōki - delivery date, lead time

「納期」is a shortened version of「納入期限（のうにゅうきげん）」, and means the time by which an order must be delivered. Many Japanese businesses place high importance on protecting set delivery dates.「納期」isn't just limited to the delivery of physical items, but can also mean the time by which a task or service needs to be finished.

**Usage examples:**
- 納期を守る（まもる）- following the set delivery date
- 納期が迫る（せまる）- the delivery date is coming up
- 納期遅れ（おくれ）- delivery delay
- 標準（ひょうじゅん）納期 - standard delivery time

### 相談 (そうだん) - sōdan - consultation, discussion

You may often need time to consider things with other members of your company rather than providing an immediate answer. Japanese companies with foreign offices may need to consult with the head office in Japan before making big decisions, as in many cases the head office may have decision-making power. When someone tells you「相談してみます」, you can respond with「返事（へんじ）はいつごろいただけますか」to ask when you might expect a response.

**Usage examples:**
- 相談中（そうだんちゅう）- under consideration
- 要相談（ようそうだん）- requires consultation
- 相談に乗る - to provide advice
- 相談を持ち掛ける（もちかける）- to consult someone

### 材料 (ざいりょう) - zairyō - materials

Raw materials or components needed for production.

### 発注 (はっちゅう) - hacchū - order, purchase order

To place an order for goods or services.

Phone communication in Japanese business has specific conventions:

- Always state your company name and your name when calling
- Use「お世話になっております」as a standard greeting
- Be more polite than in face-to-face meetings since you can't see facial expressions

### The Art of Persistent Politeness

1. Use「あの、実は」to introduce the difficult topic
2. Explain your circumstances with「～なんです」to seek understanding

4. Use「そこを何とか」to acknowledge their difficulty while persisting
5. Thank them profusely even if they only agree to consider it

### Internal Consultation (社内相談)

Japanese companies often need to consult internally before making decisions. This is not a delaying tactic but reflects:
- Consensus-based decision making
- Respect for hierarchy
- Risk management
- Collective responsibility
