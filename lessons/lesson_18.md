#18
Explaining rules politely
お気持ちはありがたいのですが、受け取らない決まりになっております。
That&apos;s so kind, but our rules do not allow me to accept a gift.
面会は何時まででしたっけ。
When do visiting hours end again?
The speaker is asking when visiting hours end, even though they have already been told this information. Attaching「～でしたっけ」is used to make confirmations or clarifications. Rather than just asking「何時までですか/でしたか」, change the「ですか/でしたか」to「でしたっけ」to make this form. This is more casual than saying「～でしたか」, so it is often used from
superiors to subordinates or among equals. When you&apos;re asking about new information, use 「面会は何時までですか」instead.
面会時間は、午後7時30分までになっております。
Our rule is that visiting hours end at 7:30 PM.
「～になっております」is used to explain that something is a rule, or has been decided. Simply saying「午後7時30分までです」is also acceptable, but using「までになっております」lets the listener know that this is an established rule.
それなら仕事終わりでも来られるね。
In that case, we could come after work.
「それなら」(In that case) is used here to mean「7時30分までなら」(since visiting hours are until 7:30).「仕事終わり」means「仕事が終わったあとでも」(even after finishing work). The 「ね」in「来られるね」is used as a confirmation. Here, it&apos;s a confirmation between family members.
父もこれで安心です。
Now we know Dad is in good hands.
「これで」is used here to mean「説明を聞いて」(Now that I&apos;ve heard this explanation) or 「入居して」(Now that he is all moved in). The speaker is speaking for his whole family in this instance.
部屋も気に入ってくれたようですし、いろいろよろしくお願いします。
It seems like he likes his room, too. Thank you.
「気に入ってくれたようです」uses the formula「気に入る（てform)＋くれた＋ようです」. The speaker is saying that he thinks his father likes his new room based on his reaction. The verb「くれた」is suitable for use here, as it is between family members. It is also okay to use in reference to subordinates. For superiors, use 「気に入ってもらったようですし、」.
よろしくお願いいたします。
Of course.
じゃ、そろそろ失礼しようか。
Well, shall we get going?
「失礼する」is used when leaving a place or room.
どうもありがとうございました。
Thank you very much.
あのこれ、少しですが、どうぞ皆さんで召し上がってください。
This is just a small gift, but please take it!
This is a phrase often used when giving gifts in Japan. 「召し上がってください」is a more respectful way to say「食べてください」. The dictionary form is 「召し上がる」and is a formal
version of「食べる」.「少しですが」is a phrase often used when giving a present. It is a humble way to say 「少なくてすみませんが」. By the way, this phrase is even used when the gift is impressive.
お気持ちだけ頂きます。
That&apos;s very kind, but I can&apos;t accept.
Due to a facility rule, the speaker cannot accept the gift. To politely refuse, use this expression to let the listener know you appreciate their kind intentions.
いえいえ。
I insist!
In this case,「いえいえ」is being used to try to get the listener to accept the gift. In other words,「そうは言わずにどうぞ受け取ってください」(Don&apos;t say that. Please, I insist that you take it!).
お気持ちはありがたいのですが、受け取らない決まりになっております。
That&apos;s so kind, but our rules do not allow me to accept a gift.
The speaker cannot accept the gift due to a facility rule, and must politely explain this to the listener. 「お気持ちはありがたい」means that you appreciate the kind gesture that the listener made by purchasing a gift. Using the phrase 「～という決まりになっております」shows that the speaker is just following a rule, and is not rejecting the gift due to personal reasons.
Kanji:
決「けつ」、決定「けってい」decision, 即決「そっけつ」sweet decision, 決まる
to be decided
そうなんですか。
Oh, is that so.
This is an expression of surprise, in this case with a nuance of disappointment.
施設の決まりだから仕方ないよ。これで失礼しよう。
Well, if it&apos;s a rule then it can&apos;t be helped. All right, let&apos;s head out.
「仕方ないよ」can also be said as「仕方がないよ」. Since the gift can&apos;t be accepted due to a facility rule, the speaker isn&apos;t able to give the gift. The 「これで」in「これで失礼しよう。」means: now that everything has been wrapped up, it is time to leave.
これで失礼いたします。
Excuse us.
