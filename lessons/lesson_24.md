## Full Script & Explanation

### Receiving the Call

**Staff Member (Protagonist)**

はい、ピザがま製造です。  
*Hai, Piza-gama Seizō desu.*  
This is Pizza Oven Makers.

> When answering the phone at work, use「はい」followed by the name of the company, rather than 「もしもし」. In many cases, people add the department name or their own name after the name of the company.

**Client (Pizzeria Maebashi)**

ピッツェリア前橋です。いつもお世話になっております。  
*Pittseria Maebashi desu. Itsumo osewa ni natte orimasu.*  
This is Pizzeria Maebashi. Thank you for everything.

> This is a standard phrase used in telephone calls, meaning 「いつもありがとうございます」. Even if you don't know the person on the other end, you use this phrase because it applies to the relationship between the two companies.

**Staff Member**

お世話になっております。  
*Osewa ni natte orimasu.*  
Thank you, as well.

> This is a response to 「いつもお世話になっております」.

### The Request

**Client**

窯の調子が悪いんですよね。  
*Kama no chōshi ga warui n desu yo ne.*  
Our oven isn't working well.

> This is an explanation of what is happening at the speaker's company. Using「～んですよね」indicates a feeling of distress.

**Client**

できれば今週の水曜日、見てもらえませんか。  
*Dekireba konshū no suiyōbi, mite moraemasen ka.*  
If possible, I'd like you to come look at it on Wednesday.

> The client is asking for a repair on a specific day. The phrase「できれば」shows consideration for the listener.

**Client**

定休日なので。  
*Teikyūbi nanode.*  
We're closed that day.

> The second half of the sentence is omitted, but the implication is that Wednesday is a convenient day for the client because their business is closed on that day.

### KEY PHRASE

**Staff Member**

申し訳ございません。  
*Mōshiwake gozaimasen.*  
My apologies.

> This is a polite apology that the speaker was unable to meet the listener's request. It's more formal than 「すみません」and is suitable for interactions with customers or clients.

**Staff Member**

その日はあいにく先約が入っております。  
*Sono hi wa ainiku sen'yaku ga haitte orimasu.*  
Unfortunately, I have a prior commitment on that day.

> 「先約」means a prior commitment. It's a polite way to let someone know you can't accommodate them, as it's understood that reservations/appointments are taken on a rolling basis. Using the word「あいにく」lets the client know that you feel sorry that you are unable to do as they would like, but are unfortunately unable to change that.

### Negotiating a Time

**Staff Member**

来週の水曜日はいかがでしょうか。  
*Raishū no suiyōbi wa ikaga deshō ka.*  
How about Wednesday next week?

> The speaker is making a suggestion for an alternative day.

**Client**

来週ですか…。  
*Raishū desu ka...*  
Next week...

> By drawing out「ですか…」, the speaker lets the listener know that they are considering the proposition, or perhaps they have decided it won't work. Their next sentence will indicate which is the case in this situation. (In fact, it's the latter; this situation just won't work.)

**Client**

週末はお客さんが多いので、金曜日までに何とかなりませんか。  
*Shūmatsu wa okyakusan ga ōi node, kin'yōbi made ni nantoka narimasen ka.*  
We have a lot of customers on the weekend. Could you come before Friday?

> The phrase「なんとかなりませんか」means「無理を言って申し訳ないが、ぜひ検討して欲しい」(I'm very sorry, but please consider it.), and shows that the speaker is in a tight situation. Even if it isn't a Wednesday, coming on a slow weekday before Friday would be their best option. This phrase communicates that desire to the listener.

**Client**

午前中にお願いしたいんです。  
*Gozenchū ni onegai shitai n desu.*  
In the morning, if possible.

> The speaker is making a request for a specific time frame.

**Staff Member**

では、木曜日の午前中はいかがでしょうか。  
*Dewa, mokuyōbi no gozenchū wa ikaga deshō ka.*  
I could do Thursday morning. Is that okay?

> The speaker is looking for a mutually agreeable time, and suggests Thursday morning.

**Client**

よかった、それで結構です。  
*Yokatta, sore de kekkō desu.*  
Oh, yes. That would be fine.

> 「よかった」shows a feeling of relief. 「それで結構です」shows that the speaker accepts the listener's proposal.

**Client**

お願いします。  
*Onegai shimasu.*  
Thank you.

**Staff Member**

かしこまりました。  
*Kashikomarimashita.*  
Of course.

> This is a more polite form of「わかりました」that is suitable for use with superiors and clients. It is not suitable for use with subordinates. For a superior you are close with, you can use 「わかりました」. Decide which to use based on your relationship to the listener.

## Vocabulary

**定休日** (teikyūbi) - scheduled day off/regular holiday  
定休日 refers to a shop or restaurant's scheduled day off. In the case of libraries and museums, the word 休館日 is used. In the case of zoos, the word 休園日 is used. The opposite of 定休日 is 営業日 (business day). Be careful when counting business days. In the case of the following phrase, scheduled holidays aren't counted: 「予約希望日の3営業日前までにお申込みください」. Some shops don't have 定休日, in which case they are「年中無休」(open year-round).  
Example: あのお店は、毎週月曜日が定休日です。(That store is always closed on Mondays.)  
Example: 美容院は火曜日が定休日のところが多い。(Many salons are closed on Tuesdays.)  
Example: あのスーパーは年中無休だ。(That supermarket is open year-round.)

**結構です** (kekkō desu) - That's fine / No thank you  
「結構です」means 「いいです」. It can have a negative meaning, depending on the context. Consider the context and the speaker's expression when deciding whether they mean it in a positive or negative way. By adding 「それで」in front to make「それで結構です」, the speaker likely means「問題ない、いいです」. If you aren't sure, don't hesitate to ask by using the following phrase: 「それは～ということですか」.  
Example (Declining): 「コーヒー、もう一杯いかがですか。」(How about another cup of coffee?) → 「（いえ、）結構です。」(I'm fine, thanks.)  
Example (Accepting/Confirming): 「コーヒーのミルクの量はこのくらいでいいですか。」(Would you like any more milk in your coffee?) → 「それで結構です。」(That's fine, thanks.)

## Kanji

**認** - acknowledge, witness, discern  
Reading: にん (nin)  
Example: 承認 (shōnin - acceptance/approval), 確認 (kakunin - confirmation), 認める (mitomeru - to recognize/admit)
