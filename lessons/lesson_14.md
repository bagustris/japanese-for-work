Responding when you&apos;ve been asked to do too many things
あの、実は今、別の仕事を頼まれています。
Actually, I was just asked to do something else.
ちょっとお願いがあるんだけど、いいかな。 Could I ask you a favor?
Use this phrase when you want to ask a favor of someone. 「いいかな」 is a phrase suitable for use from superiors to subordinates. To be more polite, use 「少しお願いがあるんですが、いいでしょうか（いいですか）」. The 「ちょっと」in「ちょっとお願いがある」may actually mean that it is a small favor, but in some cases, the favor might be a bigger one than expected. Be sure to ask exactly what is required of you when someone asks you for a favor!
なんですか。What is it?
Use 「なんですか」 only when you have a close relationship with a superior. Using 「でしょうか」 , as in 「なんでしょうか」, gives a softer and more polite impression. To be even more polite, add「はい」 to make 「はい、なんでしょうか」.
この図面で修正が見つかって、直さなければならないんだよ。
We found some errors in this diagram. It needs to be fixed.
The diagram needs to be fixed. The 「だよ」 at the end is suitable for use from superiors to subordinates. Saying 「直さなければならないんです」is a more neutral phrase, so it is acceptable for use even from subordinates to superiors.
そうですか。I see.
The falling intonation here indicates that the speaker is considering the situation.
ちょっと修正が多いんだけど、今日の４時までにやってくれるかな。
There are quite a few corrections. Could you have this done by 4?
The 「～んだけど」in 「ちょっと修正が多いんだけど」is often used when explaining a situation. Although the speaker is asking「やってくれるかな」, the meaning here is closer to an order, 「やってください」. If you won’t be able to do the favor that is asked of you, it’s better to let your superior know at this point in the conversation.
あの、実は今、別の仕事を頼まれています。
Actually, I was just asked to do something else.
When explaining your circumstances, you can use the phrase 「あの、実は・・・」. When the listener hears the phrase, it will let them know that you already have something going on. When consulting with someone, or seeking a favor, it’s a good idea to explain your current circumstances. This will help the communication process go more smoothly. In this case, the speaker is about to ask what they should do in this situation, so they are explaining that they have just been asked to do another task. By doing this, the two can decide what course of action to take together.

それはどんな仕事なの。 What were you asked to do?
The superior wants to help their subordinate decide the level of priority for the tasks that the subordinate is working on. In cases like this, be sure to explain your situation thoroughly.
和田さんから、今日の4時までにこの図面の直しを頼まれました。
Wada-san asked me to fix this diagram by 4 today.
This explanation is good because it covers three main points: who asked you to do what task, by when. If you’d like to use a verb, replacing 「図面の直し」with「図面を直す」, then use 「ように」to make 「図面を直すように」.
どちらを先にすればよろしいでしょうか。Which should I do first?
This is a polite way to ask which task to prioritize. The phrase 「どちらが先ですか」is simple, but may come across as a bit too direct or blunt. Don’t just use this phrase on its own. Use it with 「実は、今、別の仕事を頼まれているんです」to explain your current situation first.
そうか。じゃあ、これは別の人に頼んでみるよ。 I see. In that case, I&apos;ll ask someone else.
In this case, the superior has understood the situation and decided to ask someone else to take care of the task they need taken care of. For a superior talking to a subordinate, this phrase is acceptable. To be more polite, use 「そうですか。では、これは別の人に頼んでみます。」.
すみません。よろしくお願いします。Sorry about that. Thank you.
Saying 「すみません」here instead of simply 「はい、よろしくお願いします」adds the nuance that you are sorry that you couldn’t help them out. It creates a favorable impression.
Words from this Dialogue
修正「しゅうせい」
corrections
In the case of diagrams, you can use the words 「修正」or 「直し」 interchangeably. 「修正」has a slightly more formal nuance. 「直し」 gives the impression that there are not too many corrections to be made, whereas「修正」 may imply a greater number of corrections. However, this can vary case by case, so be sure to ask exactly how much is required of you with 「どのぐらいの量でしょうか」.
