#29
Reporting to a superior that a coworker is ill
少し様子を見て戻ると言っていました。病院に行くほどではないそうです。
He said he&apos;ll rest and come back. He said he wasn&apos;t sick enough to need a doctor.
うーん、なんか変なんだよね…。
I feel kind of weird.
「なんか」is a spoken version of「なにか」. The speaker may not be sure that something is wrong, or that they are really sick, but they may feel slightly &quot;off.&quot;
どうしました？
What&apos;s wrong?
The speaker notices their coworker isn&apos;t their usual self, and reaches out. This phrase is slightly more casual than「どうしましたか」. The intonation rises at the end of the phrase.
うーん…。
Err….
どこか痛いんですか。
Are you in pain?
The speaker is worried about their coworker, as it appears they could be in pain. When someone is in obvious pain, use the phrase「どこが痛いんですか」(Where does it hurt?) . By doing this, you can ask what is hurting them in particular. The phrase「～んですか」is often used to draw information from the listener. It can be used in phrases like「調子が悪いんですか」(Do you feel bad?) or「けがでもしたんですか」(Are you injured?).
あぁ、お昼ごはんを食べてから、ちょっとお腹が痛いんだ。
After I ate lunch, my stomach started hurting a bit.
The speaker is explaining the situation. The phrase「んだ」is a more casual form of「んです」. Women often use 「お腹が痛いの」or「お腹が痛いのよ」.
大丈夫ですか。病院に行きますか。
Are you okay? Do you want to see a doctor?
The speaker is worried about their coworker, and trying to figure out the severity of the situation. 「病院に行きますか」asks whether or not the coworker wants to go to the hospital. The speaker is trying to figure out how serious the illness is.
いや、そこまでじゃないよ。
No, it&apos;s not that bad.
「そこまでじゃない」means「病院に行くほどではない」. The word「そこ」isn&apos;t being used like it would be in the sentence「そこは休憩室です」. Instead, it&apos;s being used to refer back to what the previous speaker just said (in this case, going to the hospital).
じゃあ、何か薬、要りますか。それとも横になりますか。
Well, do you want some medicine? Or do you want to lie down?
「じゃあ」is a casual form of「では」. The speaker knows their coworker doesn&apos;t want to see a doctor, so instead suggests taking medicine or lying down. The phrase「それとも」is used to show the listener that they can pick from any of the speaker&apos;s suggestions.
いや、そんなに大げさにしなくて大丈夫。
No, it&apos;s not a big deal.
「大げさにする」means to exaggerate or make a big deal out of something. The speaker thinks that they don&apos;t feel unwell enough to need medicine or to lie down.
とりあえずトイレに行ってくる。
For now, I&apos;ll go to the toilet.
「とりあえず」means「この状況から考えてまずは」, or &quot;for now.&quot; The word「行ってくる」shows that the speaker intends to come back after they go to the toilet.
ちょっと休んだら戻るよ。
I&apos;ll rest for a bit and then come back.
In this case,「休んだら」isn&apos;t referring to &quot;if&quot; like in the phrase「もし休んだら」. It means &quot;after,&quot; like in「休んでから」or「休んだ後で」.
職長には、心配しないように伝えておいてくれる？
Can you tell the boss for me, so he doesn&apos;t worry?
The speaker realizes that their boss may be worried if the speaker suddenly disappears without saying anything, and asks the listener to let the boss know the situation. The phrase「伝えておいて」includes the nuance that the speaker wants the listener to let the boss know the situation ahead of time, before the boss gets worried. The phrase「〜てくれる？」is a more casual form of「〜てくれませんか」.
分かりました。
Got it.
よーし、そろそろ作業を始めるぞ。
Okay, almost time to get to work.
「よし」 is often said before getting to work, as a way to rev oneself up. It can be stretched out like「よーし」as well. The「ぞ」at the end of the sentence is used when emphasizing what one has just said, when repeating back to oneself, or to rally others. It can be used like this:
「JLPTにきっと合格するぞ」. The phrase「そろそろ」is used to signify that it is almost time to do something.
あれ、和田君はどうした？
Hm, where&apos;s Wada-kun?
The phrase「あれ？」is used when you feel surprise or doubt about something. 「どうした？」is a shortened form of「どうしましたか」「どうしたんですか」. In this case, it is being used to ask 「和田君がいないけれど、彼はどうしたんですか」. Here&apos;s an example sentence using a similar structure:「あれ？コピー機が動かない。どうしたんだろう？」(Hm? The copier isn&apos;t working. What happened?).
昼食後から、お腹が痛いとのことでトイレに行きました。
He said his stomach started hurting after lunch. He went to the toilet.
「昼食後から」means the same thing as「昼ご飯を食べてから」. The phrase「お腹が痛い」uses「～が痛い」to describe the body part that hurts. You can substitute other body parts in the place of お腹. The phrase「～とのこと」is used when relaying messages from others. It means the same thing as「〜さんが〜と言っていました」. For example, 「和田さんから電話があって、後で電話がほしいとのことです」(Wada-san called, and he said he wants you to call him back later.) . In this case, many people take a quick note of「電話がほしいとのこと」and leave the note for the relevant person.「～で」is used to explain causes and reasons.
えぇ、大丈夫か？
Oh, is he okay?
和田君は、どんな感じだった？
How bad did it seem?
「どんな感じ」means「どんな様子」. The speaker is worried about Wada-san, and asking about his condition.
少し様子を見て戻ると言っていました。病院に行くほどではないそうです。
He said he&apos;ll rest and come back. He said he wasn&apos;t sick enough to need a doctor.
「様子を見て戻ると言っていました」relays that Wada-san intends to go to the toilet, and then come back after a little while. This is an efficient way to relay messages from others. The phrases「と言っていました」and「そうです」both are used to relay messages from others. They are used in sentences like these:「休んだらすぐ戻ると言っていました」(He said he would come back after resting.) and「食後に調子が悪くなったそうです」(He started feeling ill after eating.). 「ほど」is used to express the level of something. For example, Wada-san doesn&apos;t think his illness is at the level where he needs to see a doctor. The speaker relays this message from Wada-san to their superior using「そうです」.
そうか…。じゃあ、ひとまず先に始めるか。
I see... Well, let&apos;s get back to work for now.
「ひとまず」is used as a buffer phrase. In this case, it&apos;s being used to set apart the two topics at hand: Wada-san&apos;s illness, and the need to get back to work.

Words from this Dialogue
お腹が痛い「おなかがいたい」
have a stomachache
To talk about pain in different parts of the body, you can use 「 [body part] ＋が痛い」. For example, 胃が痛い (have a stomachache), 頭が痛い (have a headache), 足が痛い (have foot pain), or 肩が痛い (have shoulder pain).
There are many different types of pain, so explaining the specific pain you feel is important. For example, when you have a stomachache, you may have any of the following symptoms: 下痢をしている(having diarrhea), お腹がはる (being bloated). In English, the word &quot;stomach&quot; is used to refer to both the organ and the general abdominal area. However, in Japanese, 「胃」is used to mean the organ known as the stomach, and お腹 is used to refer to the general abdominal area.
When describing stomach pain that is particular to the stomach organ itself, you can use phrases like 胃がしくしくする (having a dull ache in the stomach)、吐き気がする (feeling like vomiting)、気持ちが悪い (feeling unwell)、食欲がない (having a loss of appetite). Describing symptoms accurately will help doctors to provide you with better care.
このところ緊張が続いていたせいか、胃が痛い。「このところきんちょうがつずいていたせいか、いがいたい」
I&apos;ve been having bad anxiety recently, which is possibly why my stomach hurts.
ボールを投げすぎて、肩が痛くなった。ズシーンと重い痛みだ。
「ぼーるをなげすぎて、かたがいたくなった、ずうしーいんおもいいたみだ」
I threw the ball too hard, and my shoulder started hurting. I have this heavy, throbbing pain now.
病院に行く「びょういんにいく」
go to see a doctor / go to a hospital
The phrase 「病院に行く」literally means to go to a hospital, but often it is used for much less serious situations. It typically is used to mean to see a doctor.
In the Japanese medical system, there are both 病院 (hospitals) and クリニック (clinics), each with their own role. By definition, a 病院 has more than 20 病床, or beds, for use by patients. A クリニック is a facility that has fewer than 20 beds. A 診療所 is sometimes an example of a クリニック. When going to a larger hospital, you may need a letter of introduction first. It&apos;s a good idea to check over the phone before heading to the hospital.
夜中に胸が痛くなり、次の日病院に行ったら、すぐに検査入院することになった。
「よなかにむねがいたくなり、つぎのひびょういんにいったら、すぐにけんさにゅいんすることになった」
My stomach started hurting overnight. I went to see a doctor the next day, and they hospitalized me right away.
