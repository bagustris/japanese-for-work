**Okyakusama / Client**

すみません、ちょっとお聞きしたいことがあるんですけど。  
*Sumimasen, chotto okiki-shitai koto ga aru n desu kedo.*  
Excuse me, I have a question.

> 「ちょっとお聞きしたいことがあるんですけど。」is a phrase used when you want to ask a question. The word 「ちょっと」shows that the topic won't take up much time. By saying it this way, you're showing consideration for the other person. [attracting attention] When you want to ask a question at work, you can use this phrase as an opening.

**Student**

はい、どういったご用件でしょうか。  
*Hai, doo itta goyooken deshoo ka.*  
Yes, how may I help you?

> 「どういったご用件でしょうか。」is a polite way to ask what someone needs. You can also say「どんなご用件でしょうか。」or「どのようなご用件でしょうか。」. [asking for information]

**Okyakusama / Client**

かわいいものはありますか。  
*Kawaii mono wa arimasu ka.*  
Do you carry cute things?

> This client is asking if there are any products that are cute. [asking for information]

**Student**

はい、ございます。

### Clarifying What the Client Means

**Okyakusama / Client**

やっぱりかわいいものは人気があるので、多めに注文したいんです。  
*Yappari kawaii mono wa ninki ga aru node, oome ni chuumon-shitai n desu.*  
Cute things are popular, so I'd like to order a lot.

> 「やっぱり」is used to show that something is as expected or as you predicted. 「多め」means "a little more than usual" or "extra." The speaker is letting the listener know that they want to make a larger order than usual because cute items are popular. [expressing intention]

### KEY PHRASE

**Student**

かわいいと言いますと、具体的にはどういったものをお探しでしょうか。  
*Kawaii to iimasu to, gutaiteki ni wa doo itta mono o osagashi deshoo ka.*  
When you say cute, what kind of things are you looking for, specifically?

> 「と言いますと」is used when you want to understand more specifically what the other person is talking about. It can follow a noun or a phrase. By using this pattern, you're asking the speaker to clarify or elaborate on what they said. You can also use 「というと」or「と言うと」(the same phrase in hiragana).

> 「具体的には」means "specifically" or "concretely." When someone says something vague, like「かわいい」, and you need more specific information, use this word. [asking for information]

### Understanding the Client's Needs

**Okyakusama / Client**

動物のキャラクターのものなどです。  
*Doobutsu no kyarakutaa no mono nado desu.*  
Things like products with animal characters.

> 「など」means "and so on" or "et cetera." Here, the speaker is giving an example of what they're looking for. [giving factual information]

**Student**

分かりました。動物のキャラクターですね。  
*Wakarimashita. Doobutsu no kyarakutaa desu ne.*  
I understand. Animal characters.

> Repeating back what the customer has said shows that you've understood correctly. This is an important communication skill in business. [expressing agreement]

**Okyakusama / Client**

はい、特に子どもに人気のあるようなもの。  
*Hai, toku ni kodomo ni ninki no aru yoo na mono.*  
Yes, especially things that are popular with children.

> 「特に」means "especially" or "in particular." The speaker is narrowing down their request even further. [giving factual information]

**Student**

かしこまりました。それでは、お客様のご要望に合いそうな商品をいくつか写真でお送りしてもよろしいでしょうか。  
*Kashikomarimashita. Soredewa, okyakusama no goyooboo ni aisoo na shoohin o ikutsuka shashin de ookuri-shite mo yoroshii deshoo ka.*  
Certainly. Then, would it be all right if I send you photos of some products that might meet your needs?

> 「かしこまりました」is a very polite way to say you've understood. It's more formal than「分かりました」. 「ご要望」is a respectful way to say "request" or "wishes." By suggesting to send photos, the speaker is offering a solution that will help the client make their decision. [offering suggestions]

**Okyakusama / Client**

ええ、ぜひお願いします。  
*Ee, zehi onegai-shimasu.*  
Yes, please do.

> 「ぜひ」shows strong desire or eagerness. The client is enthusiastically accepting the offer. [expressing agreement]

## Cultural Notes

### Clarifying Vague Requests in Japanese Business Culture

In Japanese business communication, it's common for customers to make somewhat vague or indirect requests. Rather than stating exactly what they want, they might use general terms like "cute" or "popular." 

As a businessperson, it's your responsibility to clarify these vague requests by asking follow-up questions. The phrase「と言いますと」is perfect for this purpose because it:
1. Shows you're listening carefully
2. Doesn't make the customer feel they explained poorly
3. Helps you gather the specific information you need

This approach maintains harmony (和 - wa) while ensuring clear communication.

### Repeating Back Information

Notice how the student repeats「動物のキャラクター」back to the client. This technique, called "backchanneling" or "confirmation," is crucial in Japanese business:
- It shows active listening
- It confirms mutual understanding
- It gives the client confidence that their needs are understood

## Grammar Points

### Using「と言いますと」to Ask for Clarification

This pattern is used when you want someone to explain what they mean in more detail.

  (When you say "early," about when do you mean?)
  
- 大きいと言いますと、どのくらいのサイズでしょうか。  
  (When you say "big," about what size do you mean?)

- 難しいと言いますと、どういった点が難しいのでしょうか。  
  (When you say "difficult," in what ways is it difficult?)

### Using「など」to Give Examples

「など」is added after nouns to mean "and so on" or "such as."

**Examples:**
- りんごやみかんなどを買いました。  
  (I bought apples, oranges, and so on.)
  
- 会議の資料やペンなどを準備してください。  
  (Please prepare the meeting documents, pens, and so on.)

### The Pattern「〜に合う」

This means "to suit" or "to match."

  (This dress suits you.)
  
- 条件に合う物件を探しています。  
  (I'm looking for a property that meets the conditions.)

## Tips from this Dialogue

### やっぱり (yappari) - after all, as I thought

「やっぱり」is a casual form of「やはり」. It shows that something is as expected or as you predicted. It may also be used to mean "after all" when you thought about changing something, but then decided to stick with the present condition.

In formal situations, use「やはり」rather than「やっぱり」.

**Examples:**
- やはり工事を中止することになりました。  
  (The construction has been canceled after all.)
  
- 天気予報の通り、やっぱり今日は一日中雨が降っていた。  
  (Just like the weather report said, it ended up raining all day.)

### 特に (toku ni) - especially, in particular

「特に」is used to single out something specific from a group.

**Examples:**
- 果物の中で、特にりんごが好きです。  
  (Among fruits, I especially like apples.)
  
- 特に問題はありません。  
  (There are no particular problems.)

## Kanji

**特** - special, particular  
Reading: とく (toku)

**具** - tool, means, ingredient  
Reading: ぐ (gu)

**体** - body, substance  
Reading: たい (tai)
