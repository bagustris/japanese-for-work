## Full Script & Explanation

### Scene 1: A Coworker's Suggestion

**Coworker (同僚):**  
部長にお礼を言ったら。  
*Buchoo ni orei o ittara.*  
How about thanking buchoo?

> **Explanation:** This expression is used to give advice or make recommendations to people close to you. It's a shortened, more casual form of phrases like「お礼を言ったらどうですか」or「お礼を言ったらいかがですか」(How about saying thank you?).  
> Dropping「どうですか／いかがですか」creates a shorter, more casual phrase. This expression is not suitable for use with superiors. When you want to give advice more firmly, use「～たほうがいいですよ」(You ought to ~) instead.

**Student:**  
そうですね。  
*Soo desu ne.*  
That's true.

> **Explanation:** This expression is used to express agreement after someone has made a suggestion to you. Adding「なるほど」in front to create「なるほど、そうですね」indicates strong agreement. Depending on how you say this expression, the meaning may change. Dragging out the last syllable,「そうですねぇ」, shows that you are thinking about the suggestion.

### Scene 2: Thanking the Buchoo

**Student:**  
部長、お疲れ様でした。  
*Buchoo, otsukaresama deshita.*  
Buchoo, thank you for your hard work.

> **Explanation:** The phrase「お疲れ様でした」is used in many different situations. In this case, a subordinate is thanking his superior for his assistance.「お疲れ様でした」is often used among coworkers as a greeting, or when someone leaves for the day. This phrase is not suitable for use with clients or customers. In this case,「部長」is added in front to catch the listener's attention.

**Buchoo (部長):**  
大変だったね。  
*Taihen datta ne.*  
It was pretty tough, huh?

> **Explanation:** In this situation, a supervisor is speaking to his subordinate. To make this phrase more polite, say「大変でしたね」.

**Student:**  
お疲れ様。  
*Otsukaresama.*  
Great work.

> **Explanation:** This phrase is used throughout the day as a greeting, or at the end of the day as a goodbye. It is used among people with close relationships, coworkers, and towards subordinates. It can encompass feelings of appreciation and gratitude, depending on how it is used.「お疲れ様でした」is a more formal form of「お疲れ様」.

**Buchoo:**  
部長の娘さん、今日お誕生日だったそうですね。  
*Buchoo no musumesan, kyoo otanjobi datta soo desu ne.*  
I heard that today is your daughter's birthday.

> **Explanation:** The phrase「～（だった）そうですね」indicates that this information was told to you by someone else.「（同僚から）今日は娘さんのお誕生日だと聞きました」→「今日はお誕生日だったそうですね」(A coworker told me that today is your daughter's birthday → I heard that today is your daughter's birthday).  
> When referring to things that will happen in the future, use「～だそうですね」instead of「だったそうですね」.  
> It is necessary to add「さん」when referring to others' family members:「部長の娘さん」(your daughter),「部長の息子さん」(your son). However, you must not add「さん」when referring to your own family members:「（私の）娘」(my daughter),「（私の）息子」(my son).

**Student:**  
すみませんでした。  
*Sumimasen deshita.*  
I'm sorry.

> **Explanation:** This phrase can be used in many different situations. In this context, it is used as an apology. In this case, it is to apologize for causing the「部長」to have to stay late, although he had plans.

**Buchoo:**  
えっ、ああ、大丈夫だよ。  
*E, aa, daijoobu da yo.*  
Oh, that's all right.

> **Explanation:**「えっ」is an expression of mild surprise. The phrase「ああ、大丈夫だよ」communicates that there are no hard feelings, and not to worry.

## 🔑 KEY PHRASE

**Student:**  
**部長、手伝ってくださって大変助かりました。**  
***Buchoo, tetsudatte kudasatte taihen tasukarimashita.***  
**Buchoo, your support was extremely helpful.**

> **Explanation:**  
> The phrase「手伝ってくださって」is used by subordinates to people in a higher position. For superiors talking to subordinates,「手伝ってくれてありがとう」is used.  
>   
> Rather than the simple「助かりました」,「～してくださって助かりました」indicates the specific way that the other person helped you, making it more polite.  
>   
>「大変助かりました」is another polite way to indicate thanks. Using「とても」instead of「大変」to say「とても助かりました」gives a gentler, more casual impression. Among friends and coworkers,「助かったよ」is common.  
>   
> Substituting「ありがとうございます」for「助かりました」to make「手伝ってくださってありがとうございます」is also acceptable.

### Conclusion

**Buchoo:**  
本当にありがとうございました。  
*Hontoo ni arigatoo gozaimashita.*  
Thank you very much.

> **Explanation:** Adding「本当に」in front of「ありがとうございました」shows a deeper level of gratitude. To show thanks for something that has finished, use「ありがとうございました」rather than「ありがとうございます」.

**Buchoo:**  
ああ、気にしなくていいよ。  
*Aa, ki ni shinakute ii yo.*  
Oh, don't worry about it.

> **Explanation:** Adding「気にします」(to worry) and「～なくていい」(don't have to~) creates「気にしなくていい」. Sometimes,「も」is added in the middle of the phrase, like this:「気にしなくてもいいよ」. Similar phrases include「気にする必要はありません」and「気にする必要はないよ」. This phrase is used by superiors to subordinates, or among friends.

**Buchoo:**  
じゃあ、お先に失礼するよ。  
*Jaa, osaki ni shitsuree suru yo.*  
Well, I'm off for the day.

> **Explanation:**「じゃあ」is a spoken phrase. To say it more politely, use「では」. This phrase is used by superiors to let subordinates know that they are through for the day and leaving. When a subordinate leaves first, the expression would be either「では、お先に失礼します」or「では、お先に失礼いたします」. The「よ」following「失礼するよ」indicates clarity of intention.

**Student:**  
お疲れ様でした。  
*Otsukaresama deshita.*  
Thank you for your hard work.

> **Explanation:** In this case, the phrase is being used as a goodbye to the person leaving first.

**Buchoo:**  
お疲れ様。また明日。  
*Otsukaresama. Mata ashita.*  
Thanks. See you tomorrow.

## Cultural Notes

### The Culture of Thanks

Japan is sometimes referred to as "a culture of thanks" due to the strong tradition of saying thank you. When somebody helps you out, it's important to express gratitude. Often, it's a good idea to say thank you not just once, but twice!

For instance, if your superior treats you to dinner, you should thank them not only at that time, but the next morning as well. With clients, it's common to say thanks the next time you see them.

### Using Job Titles as Names

At some companies, it is common to call someone's name by using their position. For example,「田中さん」becomes「田中部長」or even just「部長」. This shows respect for the person's position within the company hierarchy.

### Referring to Family Members

When referring to others' family members, always add「さん」:
- 「部長の娘さん」(your daughter)
- 「部長の息子さん」(your son)

However, you must not add「さん」when referring to your own family members:
- 「（私の）娘」(my daughter)
- 「（私の）息子」(my son)
