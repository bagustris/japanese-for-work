## Full Script & Explanation

### Scene 1: The Buchoo Returns

**Wada (和田 - Coworker):**  
お疲れ様でした。  
*Otsukaresama deshita.*  
Welcome back.

> **Explanation:** This is a greeting that can be used in the workplace.「おはようございます」can be used, but「こんにちは」and「こんばんは」are not as common. In this case, it's being used as a greeting to a superior who has just come back to the office. When leaving the office for the day,「お先に失礼します」and「お疲れ様でした」are often used. However, some workplaces may see it as rude when these phrases are used with superiors. It may be a good idea to listen to what colleagues say and copy them.

**Buchoo (部長):**  
あれ、伊東くんは？  
*Are, Itoo-kun wa?*  
Huh? Where is Itoo-kun?

> **Explanation:** Itoo-kun is not in his seat.「あれ」is an expression of surprise.「伊東くんは？」is a shortened version of「伊東くんはどこですか」.

**Wada:**  
部長がお留守の間に、急に具合が悪くなって早退しました。  
*Buchoo ga orusu no aida ni, kyuu ni guai ga waruku natte sootai-shimashita.*  
She got ill while you were out and went home early.

> **Explanation:**「お留守の間に」means「いない間に」(while you were out). It's appropriate for use with superiors.「具合が悪い」means「気分が悪い」(not feeling well).「早退する」means to leave earlier than the designated time. In the workplace,「早退」is often used in place of「早く帰ります」.

**Buchoo:**  
伊東くん早退か。大丈夫かな。  
*Itoo-kun sootai ka. Daijoobu ka na.*  
Oh, he left early. I hope he's okay.

> **Explanation:**「そうか」is a casual form of「そうですか」.「早退か」is a casual form of「早退（です）か」. The「な」in「大丈夫かな」shows concern and friendliness.

### Scene 2: Asking About the Documents

**Wada (to student):**  
えっ、伊東さん早退？  
*E, Itoo-san sootai?*  
Itoo-san left early?

> **Explanation:**「えっ」is an expression of surprise or remembering. The meaning here is the same as「えっ、伊東さんが早退したんですか、本当ですか？！」and shows surprise.

**Buchoo:**  
いやぁ、急ぎの書類を頼んでいたんだけど、やってくれたかな。  
*Iyaa, isogi no shorui o tanonde ita n da kedo, yatte kureta ka na.*  
Well, I asked her for some urgent documents. I wonder if she did them.

> **Explanation:**「急ぎの書類」refers to documents that are needed quickly! You can use 急ぎ＋の＋a noun to say "something urgent." For example:「急ぎの電話」(an urgent call),「急ぎの仕事」(an urgent task).「頼んでいたんだけど」shares the same meaning as「頼みましたが」, but「頼んでいたんだけど」is more polite while still maintaining a sense of worry.「やってくれたかな」can be used by superiors to subordinates, or among equals.

**Wada:**  
伊東さん、そのことについて何か言ってなかった？  
*Itoo-san, sono koto ni tsuite nanika itte nakatta?*  
Did Itoo-san say anything about that?

> **Explanation:**「何か言ってなかった？」is a casual way of saying「何か言っていませんでしたか」. It's used by superiors to subordinates or among equals.

**はい、急ぎの書類はメールで送る、とのことです。**  
***Hai, isogi no shorui wa meeru de okuru, to no koto desu.***  
**Yes. She'll send the urgent documents via email.**

> Just follow this pattern:「伝言(messages)＋とのことです」  
>   
> **How to use it:**  
> Repeat what you were told, and then add「とのことです」to the end.

>   (My business trip is from September 10 to 15 → She said her business trip is from September 10 to 15)  
>   
> **Important:** To tell about something that hasn't happened yet, use the plain dictionary form of verbs. In this case,「急ぎの書類は(これから)メールで送ります」uses「～送る」. If the event has already happened, use the past tense. To make「メールで送りました」(She sent them by mail) use「送った、とのことです」.
