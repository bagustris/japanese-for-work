## Cultural Notes

### Requesting Time Off in Japan

Japanese workplace culture around time off:

1. **Timing matters** - Request well in advance, not last minute
2. **Choose your moment** - Ask when your superior is not busy or stressed
3. **Build rapport first** - Helping your superior before asking shows consideration
4. **Use proper phrases** - 「ご相談があります」and「お時間よろしいでしょうか」are essential
5. **Give a reason** - Even though「私用」(personal reasons) is acceptable, more specific reasons (like anniversaries) are appreciated
6. **Show gratitude** - Thank them sincerely when permission is granted

### The Importance of「お時間よろしいでしょうか」

This phrase:
- Shows respect for the superior's time
- Gives them control over the timing
- Signals an important request is coming
- Is non-demanding despite needing to ask

### Days of the Month - Special Readings

Japanese has unique readings for dates 1-10:
- 1日 - ついたち (tsuitachi)
- 2日 - ふつか (futsuka)
- 3日 - みっか (mikka)
- 4日 - よっか (yokka)
- 5日 - いつか (itsuka)
- 6日 - むいか (muika)
- 7日 - なのか (nanoka)
- 8日 - ようか (yooka)
- 9日 - ここのか (kokonoka)
- 10日 - とおか (tooka)

After 10, most use regular number + 日 (nichi), with some exceptions.

## Grammar Points

### Using「ご相談があります」to Start Important Requests

**Pattern:** ご + [noun] + があります

- お願いがあります。  
  (I have a request.)

### The Pattern「お時間よろしいでしょうか」

This is a set phrase to ask for someone's time politely.

**Breakdown:**
- お時間 = your time (honorific)

**Similar patterns:**
- 今、よろしいでしょうか。(Is now a good time?)
- お時間ありますか。(Do you have time? - less formal)
- ちょっといいですか。(Got a minute? - casual)

### Using the Conditional「ば」Form

**Pattern:** [Verb stem] + ば

This creates "if" conditions.

**Examples:**
- 行けば、会えます。  
  (If you go, you can meet them.)
  
- 頑張れば、できます。  
  (If you try hard, you can do it.)
