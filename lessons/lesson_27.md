# Lesson #27: ご無理を言って申し訳ありませんが (Gomuri o itte mōshiwake arimasen ga)

## Asking others for favors

**English Title:** Asking others for favors

---

## Role-play Setup

You work at a farm packaging produce for shipment. Today there are many orders, and it's unclear whether you'll finish packaging before the pickup time. One of your part-time workers is scheduled to leave at her regular time, but you need to ask her to stay late to help finish the work.

---

## Full Script & Explanation

### Beginning the Work

**Warni (you)**

パッケージの袋が少なくなってきたので、取ってきます。  
*Pakkēji no fukuro ga sukunaku natte kita node, totte kimasu.*  
We're almost out of bags, so I'll go get some more.

> 「取ってきます」means「取りに行ってすぐ戻ります」. The phrase「～ので、取ってきます」explains the reason why the speaker is leaving the room, and lets the listeners know she'll be back soon.

**Colleague**

今日は発注が多いですね。  
*Kyō wa hatchū ga ōi desu ne.*  
We have a lot of orders today, huh?

> The particle「ね」at the end of the sentence allows the speaker to share their feelings or thoughts with the listener. Because of this, it's used with the condition that both the speaker and listener understand the topic, are seeing the same things, and are in the same situation. In this case, the two share the same situation of having a lot of orders to process. You can use this particle in other places, in sentences like these:「山田さん、遅いですね」(Yamada-san is late, huh?) or「ずいぶん寒くなりましたね」(It's gotten cold recently, right?).

**Colleague**

集荷までにパッケージが終わりますかね。  
*Shūka made ni pakkēji ga owarimasu ka ne.*  
I wonder if we will finish packaging in time to make shipment.

> The phrase「集荷までに」indicates the time when someone will come to pick up the produce to be shipped. 「かね」at the end of the sentence conveys uncertain feelings or doubt. 「かね」can also be used to follow other words to make useful phrases like these:「できますかね」(Can we do it?)「大丈夫ですかね」(Is it okay?)「間に合いますかね」(Will she make it on time?).

**Warni (you)**

そうですね、急がないと。  
*Sō desu ne, isoganai to.*  
You're right. We'd better hurry.

> 「急がないと」is a shortened form of「急がないといけません」. The speaker is agreeing with the listener that there isn't much time left until shipment is scheduled to be picked up, so they had better hurry. The phrase「急がないといけません」can also be expressed as「急がなければなりません」. This in turn can be shortened to「急がなきゃ」.

### Discussing Staffing

**Warni (you)**

パートの林さんは、今日は何時に帰りますか。  
*Pāto no Hayashi-san wa, kyō wa nanji ni kaerimasu ka.*  
What time is Hayashi-san leaving?

> Farm work often requires the occasional help of part-time workers, who may be stay-at-home spouses. The speaker realizes that as there is a risk of not making shipment on time, they should have as many people helping out as possible. So, the speaker is asking whether Hayashi-san, a part-time worker, will be able to stay and keep helping.

**Colleague**

定時の５時に帰ると思いますよ。  
*Teiji no go-ji ni kaeru to omoimasu yo.*  
I think the regular time, 5 PM.

> The word「定時」means「決められた時間」(the decided time; the agreed time). In this case, the two are talking about the end of the standard work day. Part-time workers here only work until 5 pm. 「よ」at the end of the sentence has many uses; in this case, the speaker is using it to inform the listener of something they may not know. It may come across as rude to use this in sentences directed towards superiors, so be careful.

**Colleague**

でも、林さんに残業をしてもらわないと間に合いませんね。  
*Demo, Hayashi-san ni zangyō o shite morawan ai to ma ni aimasen ne.*  
We'll need her to stay behind if we want to finish on time.

> The speaker is highlighting the fact that they will need as much help as possible in order to make shipment on time. In this case,「ね」is added to「間に合いません」to create a softer impression than saying「間に合いませんよ」.

**Warni (you)**

そうですね。  
*Sō desu ne.*  
You're right.

**Colleague**

じゃあ、ワルニーさんからお願いしてもらえますか。  
*Jā, Warunī-san kara onegai shite moraemasu ka.*  
Warni-san, could you ask her?

> The phrase「お願いしてもらえますか」makes use of「もらえますか」to create a softer impression than using 「お願いしてください」, though the meaning is the same. The phrase「お願いしてください」has the force of an order. When the result of someone asking will benefit you as well, it's better to use phrases like「〜てもらえますか」「〜てもらえませんか」. That makes the request more polite and will encourage the listener to help.

**Warni (you)**

はい、分かりました。  
*Hai, wakarimashita.*  
Sure, got it.

**Colleague**

私、ちょっと宅配便の伝票を取ってきます。  
*Watashi, chotto takuhaibin no denpyō o totte kimasu.*  
I'm going to get a shipping label.

> The speaker needs a shipping label for today's shipments. Write the names of the sender and recipient. Use the tracking number to look up the package to check on its status.

### Hayashi's Expectations

**Hayashi (part-timer)**

あと30分！帰ったらテレビで相撲を見るのが楽しみなんですよ。  
*Ato sanjuppun! Kaettara terebi de sumō o miru no ga tanoshimi nan desu yo.*  
Only 30 more minutes! I can't wait to watch sumo wrestling when I get home.

> 「あと30分」is used to show the amount of time left that the speaker has in their workday. The word「帰ったら」means「帰った後で」.

### Making the Request

**Warni (you)**

そうなんですか…。でも林さん、ちょっといいですか。  
*Sō nan desu ka... Demo Hayashi-san, chotto ii desu ka.*  
Oh, really... Hayashi-san, could I ask you something?

> Before making a request, it's better to first get the listener's attention and ask if you can speak with them. Doing this allows the listener to mentally prepare for whatever it is you are about to say.

**Hayashi**

何ですか？  
*Nan desu ka?*  
What is it?

### KEY PHRASE

**Warni (you)**

ご無理を言って申し訳ありませんが、残業をお願いできませんか。  
*Gomuri o itte mōshiwake arimasen ga, zangyō o onegai dekimasen ka.*  
I'm so sorry to ask, but could you stay late today?

> This question is phrased in a way that it is fairly indirect, and allows the speaker to convey that they realize they are putting the listener in a difficult position. The speaker is expressing their regret at having to ask, and is asking, rather than demanding, that the listener do what the speaker is asking. The phrase「ご無理を言って」is a polite way to express「相手にとって難しいことを言う」「無理なことを言う」(asking someone to do something difficult). Just by adding this simple phrase, the listener is more likely to do what you are asking of them. These are "cushion words" that help to promote better interpersonal relationships.

**Warni (you)**

この量だと、二人だけでは作業が終わりそうにないので…。  
*Kono ryō da to, futari dake de wa sagyō ga owari-sō ni nai node...*  
With this much left, we won't be able to finish on time with just the two of us working.

> The speaker is explaining the reason why they are asking, and the current situation. The phrase「終わりそうにない」means「終わらないかもしれない」. The speaker is objectively expressing that since there is so much left to do, two people alone won't be able to finish. Sharing this allows the listener to make an informed decision.

**Hayashi**

うーん、どれぐらいの時間ですか。  
*Ūn, dore gurai no jikan desu ka.*  
Hm... How long will it take?

> The speaker is taking account of the situation and asking how much time finishing the task will require. The word「うーん」is a filler word that is used when thinking. Words like this, as well as「えーっと」,「あー」, and「あーそうですねー」can be used when you are considering something, lost, or trying to figure out what to say next.

**Warni (you)**

１時間で終わらせます。  
*Ichi-jikan de owarasemasu.*  
We'll finish in an hour.

> The speaker is clearly outlining the specific amount of time needed so that the listener can consider if they can respond positively to the request. In this case, the word「～で終わらせます」is used to clearly express the time needed.

**Hayashi**

じゃあ、相撲は家に電話して録画してもらうわ。  
*Jā, sumō wa ie ni denwa shite rokuga shite morau wa.*  
Okay. I'll call home and have them record it for me.

> 「じゃあ」is a more casual form of「では」. Here, it is being used to express「その状況だったらこうする」(If that's the case...) and reveals that the speaker is prepared to accept the listener's request. Though the speaker clearly wanted to watch sumo wrestling on TV, she said that she will have her family record it so that she can stay late and help out. Using 「（verb in dictionary form+）わ」with a falling intonation is used in casual conversation to express something one has decided, and can be used by men or women. Women often use「わ」at the end of a sentence with a rising intonation.

## Vocabulary

**パート** (pāto) - part-time worker  
There are many types of employment. 正社員 are full-time workers, and there are two types of part-time work called パート and アルバイト. Historically, パート refers to workers who have other duties, such as homemaking and raising children, and who only work part-time as a result. In contrast, the term アルバイト generally applies to students who are working part-time. However, different companies may use these terms to mean different types of work, so it's important to check the details of any job before accepting.  
Example: パート勤務は短時間労働で働く人が多い。(Many part-time workers work shorter hours.)  
Example: パートタイム労働法という法律がある。(Japan has a law called the Part-Time Employment Act.)

**定時** (teiji) - fixed time, set time  
定時 refers to a fixed or set time that workers leave each day. It varies by company, and is not decided by law. The set time outlined in work contracts or rules generally describes「定時」.  
Example: 私の会社では、９時から１７時までが定時で、それとは別に昼休みがある。(My company's hours are set from 9 am to 5 pm, and include a lunch break.)  
Example: 定時のニュースが終わったあとに、突然臨時ニュースが放送され驚いた。(After the regular news program finished, I was surprised when a special report began.)
