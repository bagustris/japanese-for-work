## Full Script & Explanation

### Agreeing on the Project Target

**Superior**

次の開発プロジェクトのターゲットはモンゴル語にしようと思うんだけど、どう思う？  
*Tsugi no kaihatsu purojekuto no tāgetto wa Mongoru-go ni shiyō to omou n dakedo, dō omou?*  
As our next development project target, I think we should focus on Mongolian. What do you think?

> During meetings, the phrase「どう思う？」is used by superiors to invite opinions from others. In response, you should state your opinion. In this case, the superior uses the phrase 「～んだけど」when sharing their opinion, before asking for the opinions of others. 「～んだけど」is used when explaining an opinion or situation, and often prefaces a question. When asking for the opinion of a superior, use「～んですが、いかがでしょうか/どう思われますか」.

**Colleague A**

いいと思います。  
*Ii to omoimasu.*  
I think that's a good idea.

> This is a response indicating agreement to the superior's proposal.
> 「～と思います」is a phrase used when sharing opinions. In a meeting, 「いいと思います」is better than「いいですね」as it indicates a more positive response.

**Protagonist**

私もいいと思います。  
*Watashi mo ii to omoimasu.*  
I agree.

> This indicates the speaker's agreement.

**Protagonist**

モンゴルは地下資源が豊富で、経済成長率も高いですし、将来有望だと思います。  
*Mongoru wa chika-shigen ga hōfu de, keizai seichō-ritsu mo takai desu shi, shōrai yūbō da to omoimasu.*  
Mongolia has underground resources and a rising GDP. It has future potential.

> This information helps explain why the speaker agreed with the proposal. When listing multiple reasons, you can use 「～し」. You can also use 「～し」after listing just one main reason to indicate that there are multiple other reasons that you agree.

**Superior**

じゃあ、モンゴル語でいいね。  
*Jā, Mongoru-go de ii ne.*  
Then it's settled.

> This confirms that the group has reached a decision. The meaning is the same as「モンゴル語で決まりですね」and「モンゴル語のプロジェクトを進めましょう」. The phrase「じゃあ」is used to show that you're summing up all the reasons that came before. In more formal situations, use「では」.

**Superior**

ティムさん、モンゴル語の専門家、知ってる？  
*Timu-san, Mongoru-go no senmonka, shitteru?*  
Tim-san, do you know any Mongolian experts?

> 「知ってる？」is a shortened version of「知っている？（知っていますか）」. In spoken Japanese, the 「い」in「ている」is often dropped. From the context, we can tell that this phrase means「モンゴル語のことがよくわかる人を知っていたら、紹介して欲しい」(If you know someone who speaks Mongolian, please introduce them to me.).

**Tim (Colleague A)**

知り合いにアジア言語の専門家がいるので、聞いてみます。  
*Shiriai ni Ajia gengo no senmonka ga iru node, kiite mimasu.*  
I know an Asian-language expert. I can ask them.

> When asked「知ってる？」, the speaker responds with 「（モンゴルの専門家は知らないが、）アジア言語の専門家を知っている」(I don't know a Mongolian expert, but I do know an Asian-languages expert.). The phrase「聞いてみます」means that the speaker will reach out, but there is no guarantee that things will work out. In cases like this, the phrase 「あたってみます」 can also be used.

**Superior**

頼んだよ。  
*Tanonda yo.*  
Please do.

> The phrase「頼んだよ」means that the superior is requesting that a subordinate take care of something. In this case, he's asking for the expert to be contacted. Superiors often use phrases like this one, as well as 「よろしく頼むよ」「よろしく（ね）」to ask subordinates to do something. This phrase cannot be used by subordinates to superiors. Instead, use 「よろしくお願いします」.

**Superior**

じゃあ、今日はこれでいいかな？  
*Jā, kyō wa kore de ii ka na?*  
Is that all for today?

> The speaker is asking if there is anything else that needs to be discussed. The meaning is the same as「これで（以上で）終わっていいですか」.

### KEY PHRASE

**Protagonist**

あの、すみません。私からひとつよろしいでしょうか。  
*Ano, sumimasen. Watashi kara hitotsu yoroshii deshō ka.*  
Excuse me. May I say something?

> It's difficult to find opportunities to speak up during meetings, especially when they are about to end. This phrase allows the speaker to raise a topic for discussion. The phrase「あの、すみません。」is used to change the subject. The phrase「よろしいでしょうか」is a more polite version of 「いいですか」. By using the word「ひとつ」, the speaker lets the listeners know that what they have to say won't take up too much time. When you need others to wait and listen to what you have to say, use this phrase.

### Raising the Issue

**Protagonist**

今週末リリース予定のページに、バグが見つかりました。  
*Konshūmatsu rirīsu yotei no pēji ni, bagu ga mitsukarimashita.*  
I found a bug in the page we're planning to release this weekend.

> Even if you are the one who discovered the bug, it's common to use the passive voice form of「見つける」(to find)、「見つかりました」(to be found). Rather than saying「私はバグを見つけました」(I found a bug.), many Japanese speakers tend to say「バグが見つかりました」(A bug was found.).

**Superior**

すぐに対応できる？リリースは間に合うの？  
*Sugu ni taiō dekiru? Rirīsu wa maniau no?*  
Can you deal with it right away? Will we still be able to release on time?

> The company's biggest goal is to protect the release date they agreed on with the client. So, this is what the speaker is asking first. To be more polite, use「対応できますか」and「間に合いますか」.

**Protagonist**

どなたかに手伝ってもらえれば、間に合います。  
*Donata ka ni tetsudatte moraereba, maniaimasu.*  
If I can get help, we'll finish on time.

> The speaker is listing conditions that need to be met in order to make the release date. When you can't deal with a problem on your own, it's important to get help and advice at a time like this. The phrase「どなたかに」is a more polite version of「だれかに」.

**Superior**

わかった、手配しよう。  
*Wakatta, tehai shiyō.*  
Okay. Let's figure it out.

> The verb「手配する」means to find or arrange people or things that can help. In this case, people are needed to help out. The superior will try to help his subordinate find someone.

**Protagonist**

お願いします。  
*Onegai shimasu.*  
Thank you.

> Since his superior will find someone to help him out, the speaker is thanking him with 「お願いします」. This creates positive feelings on both ends. To be more polite, use 「お願いいたします」. You can also use「ありがとうございます」.
