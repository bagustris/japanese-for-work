### Full Script & Explanation

#### 1. どう？ 進んでいますか。
**Dou? Susunde imasu ka.**  
*Everything going okay?*

- 「どう？」is a phrase you can use to ask about or check on progress. It can also be used as a way to get someone's attention. 「どう？」is a casual version of 「どうですか」.
- 「進んでいますか」is used here to mean 「仕事は進んでいますか」(How is work going?). In this case, the question is being used as a greeting, but in some cases the asker may actually want to hear a progress update. In this case, use「～は終わりました」(I finished ~.) or「～まで進みました」(I'm working on ~.) to answer.

#### 2. はい。
**Hai.**  
*Yes.*

#### 3. 今度の土曜日にお客様が来るんだけど、お願いした場所は全部出来ますか。
**Kondo no doyoobi ni okyakusama ga kuru n da kedo, onegai shita basho wa zenbu dekimasu ka.**  
*I have guests coming on Saturday... Can you clean all the places I asked you to clean?*

- 「～んだけど、」is used to share the feelings of the speaker with the listener. 「今週の土曜日にお客様が来ますが」is grammatically correct, but has no emotional impact. In this case, the speaker uses 「～んだけど」to communicate that they want to have a thoroughly clean house since guests are coming.

#### 4. 申し訳ありません。時間が足りなくて、難しそうです。
**Mooshiwake arimasen. Jikan ga tarinakute, muzukashisoo desu.**  
*I'm sorry. I don't think there's enough time to do everything.*

- 「申し訳ありません」is a more polite version of 「すみません」and is often used in the business world.
- 「足りなくて」means "not enough."
- Examples: お金が足りない、数が足りない (not enough money, not enough ~)
- 「難しそう」(seems difficult) is a form of 「むずかしい」(い形容詞) ＋「そうです」(difficult + looks)(様態、様子).
- In the business world, it's common to use「そうです」after「難しい」to say that something is impossible.

#### 5. そう、困ったわね。どうしよう。
**Soo, komatta wa ne. Doo shiyoo.**  
*Oh, no. That's no good. What shall I do?*

- 「そう、困ったわね」is a casual way to express「そうですか、困りましたね」.
- 「わね」is often used by women.
- 「そうか、困ったね / 困ったな」is often used by men in the workplace.

#### 6. 私が会社に電話します。
**Watashi ga kaisha ni denwa shimasu.**  
*I'll call the office.*

- Using「が」as in「私が」emphasizes that the speaker, not the listener, will be the one to make the call. In this case, it's important to let the client know that you will take care of the problem.

#### 7. そう？じゃあ、あとで連絡してくれる？
**Soo? Jaa, ato de renraku shite kureru?**  
*Really? All right, will you call them later?*

- 「そう？」is a casual form of 「そうですか？」. Here, the question includes the nuance of「いいですか？」(Is that okay?).
- 「じゃあ、あとで連絡してくれる？」means「それでは、あとで（会社に）連絡してくれますか？」(Then, will you call the company for me later?).

#### 8. 金曜日で聞いてください。
**Kin-yoobi de kiite kudasai.**  
*Ask if Friday works.*

- In this case,「聞いてください」means「確認してください」-- to ask the company if cleaning on Friday is possible.
- The「～で」in「～で聞いてください」follows the speaker's preferred conditions (in this instance, cleaning on Friday).
- Example: (予算の相談の場合) 一人3000円で聞いてください。  
  *(when asking for an estimate): Ask if they can do 3000 yen per person.*

#### 9. わかりました。
**Wakarimashita.**  
*Understood.*

#### 10. よろしくね。
**Yoroshiku ne.**  
*Thank you.*

- 「よろしくね」is often used once you have asked someone to do something. It includes the nuance of "You figure out the details." as well as "Good luck!"
- To phrase this more politely, use「よろしくお願いしますね」. However,「ね」should not be used to a superior in this context.

#### 11. もう時間だから、今日はこれでいいですよ。
**Moo jikan da kara, kyoo wa kore de ii desu yo.**  
*It's time, so that's enough for today.*

- 「もう時間だから」can be phrased more politely as「もう時間ですから」.
- 「今日はこれでいいですよ」means「今日の仕事は終わりでいいですよ」(That's enough work for today.).
- 「これでいいですよ」, depending on the context, can be used to give permission or acceptance.

#### 12. ありがとうございます。
**Arigatoo gozaimasu.**  
*Thank you.*

#### 13. 今日は遅れてしまい、申し訳ありませんでした。
**Kyoo wa okurete shimai, mooshiwake arimasen deshita.**  
*I'm terribly sorry for being late.*

- 「～てしまい」is used when something unplanned or unfortunate happens.
- Examples:
  - 「電車の事故で遅れてしまい」(The train was late.)
  - 「道に迷ってしまい」(I got lost.)
  - 「改札口を間違えてしまい」(I went out the wrong exit.)
- It can be used together with 「申し訳ありませんでした」to make an apology.
- Example: 「メールの返信が遅れてしまい、申し訳ありませんでした」  
  *I'm very sorry to have sent the email late.*
- It's important to apologize for two things: first, being half an hour late, and second, that the cleaning time was reduced from two hours to one and a half hours. Besides apologizing on arrival, it's also important to apologize again while leaving. When you have inconvenienced a client, apologies are of the utmost importance!

#### 14. 気をつけて帰ってくださいね。
**Ki o tsukete kaette kudasai ne.**  
*Be careful on your way back!*

- This phrase is used when saying goodbye, especially when there is the possibility of an accident or bad weather, or when the listener might not be feeling well.
- This phrase isn't used very often in the business world. In this case, the client is showing concern about the train accident and delay.

#### 15. それでは、失礼します。
**Sore dewa, shitsurei shimasu.**  
*I'll be leaving now.*

- This phrase is used when taking one's leave. It can be used at one's own office or at a client's office.
- To make this phrase more polite, use「それでは、失礼いたします」.

### Vocabulary

| Japanese | Romanization | Meaning |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| 今度 | kondo | next time, coming |
| 申し訳ありません | mooshiwake arimasen | I'm terribly sorry (formal) |
| 足りない | tarinai | not enough, insufficient |

#### Key Term: 今度 (こんど / kondo) - Next time

「今度の土曜日」means "the coming Saturday."

In the workplace, you may often hear 「今度飲みましょう」(Let's go out drinking sometime!) or 「今度カラオケに行きましょうよ」(Let's go to karaoke sometime!), but these are often just used to be friendly or polite. There's no need to actually go, but if you would like to, try to set a date yourself!

**Examples:**
- 今度の週末 (kondo no shuumatsu) - Next weekend
- 今度の休暇 (kondo no kyuuka) - Next day off
- 今度の出張 (kondo no shucchou) - The next business trip

#### Key Term: よろしく (yoroshiku) - Please take care of it

Superiors often use this phrase to mean "You take care of it from here." Sometimes, this can be a very vague instruction, so if you aren't sure exactly what you're being asked to do, it's a good idea to clarify. Since you are being trusted to do something, you are expected to do a good job!

### Cultural Notes

**Apology Culture in Japanese Business**

Japanese business culture places enormous importance on apologies, especially when you have inconvenienced a client. Key points:

1. **Multiple apologies**: Apologize when you arrive late, and apologize again when leaving. Repeated apologies show sincerity.

2. **Take responsibility**: Use phrases like 「私が～します」(I will...) to show you're taking personal responsibility for solving the problem.

3. **Use formal language**: 「申し訳ありません」is more appropriate than「すみません」for serious situations.

4. **Explain but don't over-excuse**: Briefly mention the reason (train accident) but focus on the apology and solution.

5. **Offer solutions**: Don't just apologize—propose ways to fix the situation (calling the office to arrange another day).

**The ～てしまい Pattern**

This grammatical pattern conveys regret about an unfortunate occurrence. It shows that:
- The situation was beyond your control
- You recognize it as unfortunate
- You take responsibility despite the circumstances

### Grammar Points

#### 1. ～んだけど for Emotional Context
- **Pattern:** Verb (plain form) + んだけど
- **Meaning:** Provides emotional context or background for a request
- **Example:** お客様が来るんだけど (Guests are coming, so...)
- More personal and emotionally engaging than just using が or けれど

#### 2. ～てしまい for Regrettable Occurrences
- **Pattern:** Verb (て-form) + しまい
- **Meaning:** "ended up..." (with regret)
- Used before apologies to show something unfortunate happened

  - 忘れてしまい (wasurete shimai) - ended up forgetting
  - 間違えてしまい (machigaete shimai) - ended up making a mistake

#### 3. 申し訳ありません vs. すみません
- **申し訳ありません** (mooshiwake arimasen)
  - More formal and serious
  - Used for significant inconveniences or mistakes
  - Common in business contexts
  - Past tense: 申し訳ありませんでした

- **すみません** (sumimasen)
  - General-purpose apology
  - Can also mean "excuse me" or "thank you"
  - Less formal
  - Past tense: すみませんでした

#### 4. Particle が for Emphasis
- **Pattern:** Noun + が + Verb
- **Example:** 私が会社に電話します (I will call)
- Emphasizes the subject—contrasting with others
- Shows you're taking responsibility

#### 5. ～で for Conditions
- **Pattern:** Noun + で + 聞く/確認する
- **Meaning:** "under the condition of..." / "with..."
- **Example:** 金曜日で聞いてください (Ask about Friday)
- Indicates preferred terms or conditions

### Tips from this Dialogue

1. **Apologize multiple times**: When you've inconvenienced someone, apologize both at the beginning and end of the interaction
2. **Take initiative**: Offer solutions (like calling the office) rather than leaving the problem to the client
3. **Use emphatic が**: When proposing to take action, use 「私が」to emphasize your responsibility
4. **Be specific about alternatives**: When something isn't possible, propose specific alternative dates or solutions
5. **Match politeness levels**: Use formal language (申し訳ありません) with clients, more casual forms (すみません) with colleagues
