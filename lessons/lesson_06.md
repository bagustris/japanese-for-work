### Role-play Setup
**Scene:** A company office where employees are finishing their work for the day. One employee (Vuong-san) needs to leave early to attend Japanese language school, but hasn't finished the assigned work. A colleague (Wada-kun) volunteers to help.

**Characters:**
- **Buchoo (部長)**: Department manager
- **Wada-kun (和田君)**: A colleague who offers to help
- **Vuong-san (ブオンさん)**: Employee who needs to leave early

### Full Script & Explanation

#### 1. 和田君、進捗はどう？
**Wada-kun, shinchoku wa dou?**  
*Wada-kun, how are things going?*

- 進捗 (shinchoku) means "progress." In other words, 「（仕事は）どのぐらい進んでいるか」(How is work going?).
- 「どう？」is an abbreviated form of 「どうですか」.
- It can be used from superiors to subordinates, or among equals.

#### 2. はい、あとちょっとです。
**Hai, ato chotto desu.**  
*Nearly done.*

- 「ちょっと」means "a little," like 「少し（すこし）」.

#### 3. ブオンさんはどう？
**Vuong-san wa dou?**  
*Vuong-san, what about you?*

#### 4. 今日中にできるかな？
**Kyoo-juu ni dekiru ka na?**  
*Will you be able to finish today?*

- By adding 「かな」to「できるかな？」, it becomes a more familiar expression. In this case, the phrase is being used by a superior to a subordinate they are fond of.
- By stretching out the 「な」sound so it becomes 「できるかなあ」, it adds an element of doubt. As opposed to「できる？」, a direct question, adding 「かな」creates a softer impression. It sounds almost as if one is talking to oneself.

#### 5. すみません、今日中は難しいです。
**Sumimasen, kyoo-juu wa muzukashii desu.**  
*I'm sorry, I don't think today is possible.*

- 「今日中は難しいです」is a shortened version of「今日中に仕事を終わらせるのは難しいです」.
- 「難しい」literally means "difficult." However, it is often used to say something is impossible.

#### 6. 部長、その仕事、僕が引き受けます。
**Buchoo, sono shigoto, boku ga hikiukemasu.**  
*Buchoo, I'll take care of it!*

- A colleague has offered to take over the job. 「やります」or「します」are also acceptable here, but「引き受ける」shows a stronger sense of taking responsibility.

#### 7. そうか、ありがとう。
**Soo ka, arigatoo.**  
*Really? Thanks.*

#### 8. じゃあ、和田くん頼んだよ。
**Jaa, Wada-kun tanonda yo.**  
*Over to you, then, Wada-kun.*

- 「頼んだよ」is a casual way to express「頼みましたよ」.

#### 9. 和田さん、ありがとうございます。助かります。
**Wada-san, arigatoo gozaimasu. Tasukarimasu.**  
*Wada-san, thank you. That's a big help.*

#### 10. どういたしまして。
**Doo itashimashite.**  
*You're welcome.*

#### 11. すみませんが、お先に失礼してもよろしいでしょうか。
**Sumimasen ga, osaki ni shitsurei shite mo yoroshii deshoo ka.**  
*May I please be excused?*

- 「よろしいでしょうか」is a more polite way of asking「いいですか」. It's appropriate for use with superiors.
- In this case, the speaker is asking for permission to leave to attend Japanese language school. They are also apologizing for having to ask someone else to take over their work.
- In the workplace,「帰っても（いいですか）」(Can I go home?) is not commonly used.
- Pattern: て形＋よろしいでしょうか
- Example: 「この書類を送ってもよろしいでしょうか」(May I send these documents?)

#### 12. ああ、いいよ。
**Aa, ii yo.**  
*Sure.*

- 「ああ、いいよ。」is a casual form of「ああ、いいですよ」. It can be used by superiors to subordinates or among equals.

#### 13. 明日は大丈夫だよね。
**Ashita wa daijoobu da yo ne.**  
*Tomorrow will be no problem, right?*

- 「～だよね」is often added onto phrases such as「明日はだいじょうぶだよね」when asking for confirmation.
- In this case, a lot is left unsaid. The full meaning of the sentence looks like this: 「明日（あなたは）仕事ができると（私は）思っているけど、それで大丈夫ですね（いいですよね）？」.

#### 14. はい、明日は大丈夫です。
**Hai, ashita wa daijoobu desu.**  
*Yes, I will.*

#### 15. よろしくお願いします。
**Yoroshiku onegai shimasu.**  
*Thank you.*

#### Key Term: 進捗 (しんちょく / shinchoku) - Progress

進捗（しんちょく）means progress. It's common to be asked for an update on 「進捗」at work, so it's a useful term to remember.

**Examples:**
- 進捗状況を教えてください。(Shinchoku jookyoo o oshiete kudasai.)  
  *Can you give me an update on your progress?*

- 進捗が遅く、スケジュール変更をしなければならなくなった。(Shinchoku ga osoku, sukejuuru henkoo o shinakereba naranaku natta.)  
  *Progress is going slowly, so we had to change the schedule.*

- 次の会議で進捗状況を共有する予定です。(Tsugi no kaigi de shinchoku jookyoo o kyooyuu suru yotei desu.)  
  *I'll give an update at the next meeting.*

#### Key Term: 難しい (むずかしい / muzukashii) - Difficult

「難しい」sometimes has the same meaning as「困難」(difficulty) or 「大変」(considerable). It can also often be used to say「できない」, or that something is impossible, particularly in tricky or sensitive situations. If you hear 「難しい」, the outlook isn't good!

### Cultural Notes

**Workplace Hierarchy and Requesting Permission**

In Japanese workplaces, there's a strong emphasis on hierarchy and respect for superiors. When asking to leave early, employees should:

1. **Time it appropriately**: Don't ask when the workplace is particularly busy
2. **Offer solutions**: If possible, ensure your work is covered (as Wada-kun does here)
3. **Use formal language**: 「よろしいでしょうか」is more appropriate than「いいですか」
4. **Show appreciation**: Thank colleagues who help cover your work
5. **Avoid direct expressions**: Instead of 「帰ってもいいですか」(Can I go home?), use 「お先に失礼してもよろしいでしょうか」

**The concept of 「お先に」(osaki ni)**

This phrase literally means "ahead (of others)" and acknowledges that you're leaving while others are still working. It shows awareness of the group dynamic and respect for those who will continue working.

### Grammar Points

- **Casual form:** どう？(dou?)
- **Polite form:** どうですか。(dou desu ka.)
- Used by superiors to subordinates or among equals to check on progress or status.

#### 2. Sentence-ending 「かな」for Soft Questions
- **Pattern:** Verb + かな
- **Example:** できるかな？(dekiru ka na?) - "I wonder if you can do it?"
- Adds a softer, more contemplative tone to questions
- Sounds almost like thinking aloud

#### 3. Permission Pattern: ～てもよろしいでしょうか
- **Pattern:** Verb (て-form) + もよろしいでしょうか
- **Meaning:** "Would it be alright if...?" / "May I...?"
- Very polite form for asking permission
- **Examples:**
  - 座ってもよろしいでしょうか。(suwatte mo yoroshii deshoo ka.) - May I sit down?
  - この書類を送ってもよろしいでしょうか。(kono shorui o okutte mo yoroshii deshoo ka.) - May I send these documents?

#### 4. Casual Confirmation with 「だよね」
- **Pattern:** Statement + だよね
- **Meaning:** "right?" / "isn't it?"
- Used to seek confirmation in a casual, friendly way
- **Example:** 明日は大丈夫だよね。(ashita wa daijoobu da yo ne.) - Tomorrow will be no problem, right?

#### 5. 「難しい」as Indirect Refusal
- 「難しい」literally means "difficult" but often functions as a polite way to say "impossible" or "no"
- This indirect expression is common in Japanese business culture to avoid direct refusals

### Tips from this Dialogue

1. **Always offer solutions**: When you need to leave early, try to ensure your work is covered or will be completed
2. **Use the correct register**: Match your politeness level to the person you're speaking with
3. **Show gratitude multiple times**: Thank both the person giving permission and anyone covering for you
4. **Be specific about availability**: Vuong-san confirms they can complete the work tomorrow
5. **Use 「お先に失礼します」**: This is the standard, polite way to announce you're leaving work
