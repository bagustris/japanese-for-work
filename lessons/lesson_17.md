# Lesson 17: よければ、いつでも相談に乗りますよ (Yokereba, Itsudemo Sōdan ni Norimasu yo)

## Offering Support to Subordinates

**English Title:** Supporting a troubled subordinate

---

## Role-play Setup

You are a manager or senior colleague who has noticed that a subordinate (Wada-san) seems troubled and stressed about work. Your department head has asked you to check on Wada-san and offer support. You need to approach Wada-san in a way that is helpful but not pushy, making it clear that you're available to help if needed while respecting their autonomy.

## Full Script & Explanation

### Scene 1: Being Asked to Check on a Colleague

**Manager (Praid):**  
ちょっといいですか。  
*Chotto ii desu ka.*  
Can I have a word?

> **Grammar Note:** When asking a coworker if it is okay to have a quick word, use this phrase. It's important to use phrases like this to show respect for your coworker's time.

**Department Head:**  
和田さんのことなんですけど。  
*Wada-san no koto na n desu kedo.*  
It's about Wada-san.

> **Grammar Note:** It's important to start off with what you would like to talk about.「～のことなんですが」uses「が」in the place of「けど」to be more polite.

---

### Scene 2: Discussion About the Subordinate

**Department Head:**  
昨日もかなり悩んでいたみたいなんですよね。  
*Kinō mo kanari nayande ita mitai na n desu yo ne.*  
It seems that something was really bothering him again yesterday.

> **Grammar Note:** 「～みたい」is used to show one's perceptions or judgments.「よね」is added to the end of this sentence to create a softer impression.

**Department Head:**  
プライドさん、様子を見て和田さんに声をかけてみてくれるかな。  
*Puraido-san, yōsu o mite Wada-san ni koe o kakete mite kureru ka na.*  
Praid-san, could you keep an eye on Wada-san, and reach out to him?

> **Grammar Note:** 「様子を見て声をかける」is used to mean to keep an eye on someone and perhaps ask「どうですか。大丈夫ですか、大変なことはありませんか」or offer words of support if it appears they are needed.

**Praid:**  
はい、わかりました。  
*Hai, wakarimashita.*  
Yes, certainly.

---

### Scene 3: Time to Leave

**Department Head:**  
部長、そろそろ行きましょうか。  
*Buchō, sorosoro ikimashō ka.*  
Buchō, shall we head out?

> **Grammar Note:** 「そろそろ」is a useful phrase to let a listener know that it is time to move on to the next task. Phrases like「そろそろ会議の時間です」(It's nearly time for the meeting.) and「そろそろ取引先の方が来る時間です」(The client will be here soon.) or「そろそろ行きましょうか」(Shall we head out now?) and「そろそろ帰りましょうか」(Is it about time to go home?) are key in prompting a listener to take action.

**Department Head:**  
じゃ、頼んだよ。  
*Ja, tanonda yo.*  
I'm counting on you.

> **Grammar Note:** 「じゃ、頼んだよ」is a more casual form of「では、頼みましたよ」. It's a way for a superior to ask a subordinate to carry out a task.

**Praid:**  
はい、承知しました。  
*Hai, shōchi shimashita.*  
Yes, I understand.

> **Grammar Note:** When a superior asks a subordinate to do a task,「はい、わかりました」is an acceptable response. But to be more polite, use「承知しました」, the humble form of「わかりました」.

---

### Scene 4: Approaching the Subordinate

**Praid:**  
和田さん、作業はどうですか。  
*Wada-san, sagyō wa dō desu ka.*  
Wada-san, how is work going?

> **Grammar Note:** When talking with a troubled subordinate, use open-ended questions like「どうですか」to give them the floor and create a more approachable environment.「和田さん、何か問題はありませんか」is too direct, and assumes that there is some sort of problem. It is better to avoid an approach like this. Instead of「作業」, you can also use「進み具合（すすみぐあい）はどうですか」to ask how things are going.

**Wada:**  
はい、何とか。  
*Hai, nantoka.*  
I'm getting by.

> **Grammar Note:** 「何とか」means that although things are difficult, one is getting by. From this response, it is clear that the subordinate isn't doing well.

---

### Scene 5: Offering Help

**Praid:**  
何か手伝いましょうか。  
*Nanika tetsudaimashō ka.*  
Is there anything I can help with?

> **Grammar Note:** By adding「何か」in front of「手伝いましょうか」, you can ask if there is anything specific that you might be able to help with.「～ましょうか」is a verb ending that makes an offering of help or support. Examples: 「手伝いましょうか」(Shall I help with that?),「持ちましょうか」(Shall I carry that?),「私がやりましょうか」(Shall I do that?).

**Wada:**  
ありがとうございます。でも大丈夫です。  
*Arigatō gozaimasu. Demo daijōbu desu.*  
Thank you. But I'm okay.

> **Grammar Note:** The「でも」in「でも大丈夫です」shows that the speaker strongly feels that they must carry out the work, because it is the work they have been tasked with. Depending on someone's personality, it may be difficult for them to ask for help or advice when they need it. A good leader must be mindful of these sorts of needs.

**Wada:**  
もう少し自分でやってみます。  
*Mō sukoshi jibun de yatte mimasu.*  
I'll try on my own for now.

> **Grammar Note:** The subordinate wants to try handling the situation themselves before asking for help.

## 🔑 KEY PHRASE

**よければ、いつでも相談に乗りますよ。**  
***Yokereba, itsudemo sōdan ni norimasu yo.***  
**If you ever need anything, just come to me.**

> **Explanation:**  
> This phrase is perfect for offering support to a subordinate who may be struggling but is hesitant to ask for help:
> 1.「よければ」- "if you want/if it's okay with you" (leaves the choice to them)
> 2.「いつでも」- "anytime" (shows ongoing availability)
> 3.「相談に乗る」- "provide advice/listen to concerns" (specific offer of support)
> 4.「よ」- friendly particle that reinforces the offer
> 
> By adding「よければ」to the beginning of the sentence, the speaker leaves it up to the listener whether or not to ask for help or advice. This respects the subordinate's autonomy while clearly communicating availability.「相談に乗る」is a good phrase to use to a subordinate who may be struggling, or have too much work to handle.

---

### Scene 6: Accepting the Offer

**Wada:**  
はい、ありがとうございます。  
*Hai, arigatō gozaimasu.*  
Thank you.

> **Grammar Note:** The subordinate appreciates the offer of support, even if they don't take it up immediately.

## Vocabulary

### 作業 (さぎょう) - sagyō - work, task

「作業」is often used to mean the same thing as 仕事 (work) or 仕事をすること (working).「作業」differs from「仕事」in that it generally refers to a task with a specific goal in mind. Following orders from a superior falls under「作業」. It represents a smaller task, rather than an overall job.

**Usage examples:**
- 作業中（さぎょうちゅう）- working, in progress
- 作業服（さぎょうふく）- work uniform
- 修復作業（しゅうふくさぎょう）- repair work
- 作業を進める - to advance the work

### 声をかける (こえをかける) - koe o kakeru - reach out, call out to

「声をかける」can mean to call someone or to strike up a conversation, or make an invitation. It is often used in spoken conversation. As a noun, it is called「声かけ」, and may also be used as「声かけをする」as a verb.

**Usage examples:**
- 悩（なや）んでる部下に声をかける - Reach out to a troubled subordinate
- 今度登山（とざん）に行くときは声をかけてください - Let me know next time you go mountain climbing
- 気軽に声をかけてください - Please feel free to reach out

## Cultural Notes

### Supporting Subordinates in Japanese Workplaces

Japanese management culture emphasizes:
- **Indirect observation** - Watch for signs rather than asking directly "What's wrong?"
- **Offering without forcing** - Use「よければ」to leave the choice to them
- **Creating openness** - Use open-ended questions like「どうですか」
- **Respecting autonomy** - Allow subordinates to try on their own first
- **Staying available** - Make it clear you're there if needed

### The Concept of 様子を見る (Yōsu o Miru)

「様子を見る」means to observe someone's condition or situation. It's an important skill in Japanese management:
- Watch for signs of stress or trouble
- Don't immediately intervene
- Choose an appropriate time to reach out
- Use casual, non-threatening language
- Offer support without being pushy

### Why Subordinates May Not Ask for Help

In Japanese work culture:
- Asking for help may be seen as showing weakness
- There's pressure to handle one's own responsibilities
- People may not want to burden others
- Pride in completing assigned tasks independently

Good leaders need to be proactive in offering support while respecting these feelings.
