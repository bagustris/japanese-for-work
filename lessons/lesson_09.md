### Full Script & Explanation

#### 1. すみません。
**Sumimasen.**  
*Excuse me.*

- This phrase is often used to begin a conversation. When you feel a bit hesitant to begin a conversation, use 「あのーすみません」.

#### 2. 私の席はどこか、教えていただけませんか。
**Watashi no seki wa doko ka, oshiete itadakemasen ka.**  
*Could you please show me my seat?*

- This phrase combines two separate phrases,「私の席はどこですか」and「教えてください」, into one polite question.
- Pattern: 疑問詞（interrogative) ＋ か
- 「私の席はどこか教えていただけませんか」
- To phrase this with a verb, use 「どこに座るかは、みんなに聞いてください」.
- 「～ていただけませんか」is a very polite way to phrase a question.

**Examples:**

①席を聞く時 → 私の席はどこか教えていただけませんか。  
*To ask where you should sit → Could you please show me my seat?*

The following phrases are also polite: 「私の席はどこでしょうか。」「 私の席はどちらでしょうか。」  
However, 「私の席はどこですか」may come across as too abrupt.

②会議に出る人の数を聞く時 → 何人（来る）か教えていただけませんか。  
*To ask how many people will attend a meeting → Could you please tell me how many people will be at the meeting?*

The following phrases are also polite: 「何人いらっしゃいますか。」「何人でしょうか。」  
However,「何人ですか。」may come across as too abrupt, and is not appropriate for use with clients.

#### 3. ああ、こちらです。どうぞ。
**Aa, kochira desu. Doozo.**  
*Oh, here it is. Take a seat.*

- The 「ああ」in 「ああ、こちらです」is used to show that the speaker realizes the listener didn't know this important information. In other words:「ああ、そうですね（ご存知ないですよね、伝え損ねていましたよね）」(Oh, that's right, you didn't know that / I forgot to tell you).
- Here,「どうぞ」is being used to direct the listener to their seat.

#### 4. ありがとうございます。
**Arigatoo gozaimasu.**  
*Thank you.*

#### 5. あ、イルビンさん。今日は打ち合わせがあるんですよ。
**A, Irving-san. Kyoo wa uchiawase ga aru n desu yo.**  
*Oh, Irving-san. Today we have a meeting.*

- 「あ」is used to show that the speaker just remembered something.
- 「今日は打ち合わせがあります」is also correct. However,「打ち合わせがあるんですよ」includes the nuances of 「知っていますか」and「新しい情報ですね？」(Did you know that?).
- 「んです」is often used to explain a situation. In some cases, this may precede asking for a favor.

#### 6. あと15分で始まります。
**Ato 15-fun de hajimarimasu.**  
*It will start in 15 minutes.*

- 「あと15分」has the same meaning as「15分後（ご）」. Here, 「打ち合わせ」is omitted from the sentence, as both the speaker and listener are aware of the context.

#### 7. わかりました。
**Wakarimashita.**  
*Understood.*

- 「わかりました」is an acceptable phrase, but to be more polite use 「承知しました」or the even more polite「承知いたしました」.

#### 8. このモニターを、あそこの会議室へ運んでもらえませんか。
**Kono monitaa o, asoko no kaigishitsu e hakonde moraemasen ka.**  
*Could you take this monitor to that meeting room?*

- 「～てもらえませんか」is a polite phrase used to ask someone to do something.
- To be even more polite, use 「運んでいただけませんか」.
- To coworkers and subordinates, you can use 「運んでください」or the even more casual「運んで！」.

#### 9. どちらの会議室か、教えていただけませんか。
**Dochira no kaigishitsu ka, oshiete itadakemasen ka.**  
*Could you please let me know which meeting room it is?*

- Combining the two phrases「どちらの会議室ですか」and「教えてください」makes one polite question.
- 「どの・・・」is acceptable, but「どちらの・・・」is more polite.

#### 10. あっ、すみません。会議室Bです。
**Ah, sumimasen. Kaigishitsu B desu.**  
*Oh, sorry! It's Meeting Room B.*

- The speaker begins with 「あっ、すみません」because they didn't initially tell the listener which room to take the monitor to.

#### 11. わかりました。
**Wakarimashita.**  
*Understood.*

#### 12. 会社のパンフレットを人数分用意してもらえませんか。
**Kaisha no panfuretto o ninzuubun yooi shite moraemasen ka.**  
*Could you get enough pamphlets for everyone attending?*

- 「人数分」means "the amount for the number of people." In this case, it means enough pamphlets for everyone attending the meeting.
- When you know the exact number of people at the meeting, use that number: 「30人分」.

#### 13. そこにあります。
**Soko ni arimasu.**  
*They're over there.*

- In this case,「会社のパンフレット」is omitted because both the speaker and the listener know the context.
- When speaking to a superior, use 「そちら」to be more polite.

#### 14. 何人か教えていただけませんか。
**Nan-nin ka oshiete itadakemasen ka.**  
*Could you tell me how many people will attend?*

- The speaker combines「何人ですか」and「教えてください」to make one polite question.

#### 15. 全部で6人です。
**Zenbu de 6-nin desu.**  
*Six people altogether.*

#### 16. わかりました。
**Wakarimashita.**  
*Understood.*

#### Key Term: 打ち合わせ (うちあわせ / uchiawase) - Meeting

「打ち合わせ」「会議」and「ミーティング」are all words that can refer to meetings held in the workplace. Different companies may use different words to refer to meetings.

Out of these three, **会議 (kaigi)** is the most formal. A 議事次第（アジェンダ）(agenda) is prepared, and a 進行役 (facilitator) leads the meeting. The number of people in attendance may range from just a few to more than twenty.

**ミーティング (miitingu)** can often be used interchangeably with「会議」, but often is a more casual meeting than a 「会議」.

An **打ち合わせ (uchiawase)** is often used as a "pre-meeting" held before deciding something. Here, you can generally share your opinions freely.

**Example:** 「来週の会議の前に、一度打ち合わせをしよう」(Let's have a pre-meeting before next week's meeting.)

In this case,「会議」is clearly more formal. The「打ち合わせ」will be used to decide the topics of conversation, necessary materials, and other information needed to hold the main meeting.

Depending on the company, all three words may be used to mean the same thing or different things!

**Example sentence:**  
10日に会議があるから、その前に一度打ち合わせをしませんか。お時間ありますか。  
*(とうかにかいぎがあるから、そのまえにいちどうちあわせしませんか、おじかんあるますか。)*  
*We have a meeting on the 10th. If you have time, would you like to hold a pre-meeting before that?*

#### Key Term: 人数分 (にんずうぶん / ninzuubun) - Enough for everyone

人数 means the number of people. 分 refers to an amount. Here,「人数分用意してもらえませんか」means "Please prepare enough for everyone." In this case, "everyone" means the people who are attending the meeting. If 6 people are attending the meeting, then 「6人分」is an acceptable answer. You can also use「6名分（ろくめいぶん）」. For more formal situations,「名（めい）」is preferable.

**Examples:**

「名札を人数分用意して」なふだをにんずうぶんよういして.  
*Please prepare enough nametags for everyone.*

「3名分のお茶を用意して」さんめいぶんのおちゃをよういして.  
*Please prepare three cups of tea.*

「1000円分の印刷用紙を買ってきて」せんえんぶんのいんさつようしをかってきて.  
*Buy 1000 yen's worth of printer paper.*

### Cultural Notes

**Asking Questions in Japanese Workplaces**

In Japanese business culture, how you ask questions is as important as what you ask. Key considerations:

1. **Start with すみません**: This softens the interruption and shows politeness
2. **Use embedded questions**: Instead of direct questions, embed them in polite request forms
3. **Know your hierarchy**: Use more polite forms when asking superiors or people you don't know well
4. **Acknowledge information**: Use 「わかりました」or「承知しました」to confirm understanding
5. **Thank people**: Always express gratitude when receiving help or information

**First Day Protocol**

On your first day at a Japanese workplace:
- Expect to ask many questions about logistics (seat, equipment, meetings)
- Use formal language even with peers until you understand the office culture
- Take notes so you don't have to ask the same question twice
- Confirm details even if they seem obvious

---

### Grammar Points

#### 1. Embedded Questions with か
- **Pattern:** Question word + か + Verb phrase
- **Meaning:** "whether..." / "what..." / "where..." etc.
- **Examples:**

  - 何人か (nan-nin ka) - how many people
  - どちらの会議室か (dochira no kaigishitsu ka) - which meeting room

#### 2. ～ていただけませんか for Polite Requests
- **Pattern:** Verb (て-form) + いただけませんか
- **Meaning:** "Could you please...?" (very polite)
- **Examples:**
  - 教えていただけませんか (oshiete itadakemasen ka) - Could you please tell me?
  - 運んでいただけませんか (hakonde itadakemasen ka) - Could you please carry it?
- More polite than ～てもらえませんか

#### 3. ～てもらえませんか for Requests
- **Pattern:** Verb (て-form) + もらえませんか
- **Meaning:** "Could you...?" (polite)
- **Example:** 運んでもらえませんか (hakonde moraemasen ka) - Could you carry it?
- Less formal than ～ていただけませんか but still polite

#### 4. んです for Explanation
- **Pattern:** Verb/Adjective (plain form) + んです
- **Meaning:** Adds explanatory tone, "the thing is..." / "you see..."
- **Example:** 打ち合わせがあるんですよ (uchiawase ga aru n desu yo) - We have a meeting (you see)
- Often precedes requests or provides context

#### 5. あと for "Remaining Time"
- **Pattern:** あと + Time expression + で
- **Meaning:** "in..." / "after..."
- **Example:** あと15分で始まります (ato 15-fun de hajimarimasu) - It starts in 15 minutes
- Same meaning as ～後（ご）but more casual

### Tips from this Dialogue

1. **Ask before the last minute**: Irving asks about the meeting details when there are still 15 minutes remaining
2. **Confirm details**: When given a task, confirm all necessary details (which room, how many pamphlets, etc.)
3. **Use embedded questions**: Combine direct questions with polite request forms for smoother communication
4. **Acknowledge repeatedly**: Say「わかりました」after each instruction to show understanding
5. **Don't assume**: Even if something seems obvious (like which meeting room), ask if you're not sure
