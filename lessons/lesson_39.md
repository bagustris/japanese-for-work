## Full Script & Explanation

### The Meeting

**Jooshi / Superior**

それでは、来週金曜日の勤務についてなんですが。  
*Soredewa, raishuu kin-yoobi no kinmu ni tsuite nan desu ga.*  
Now, about working next Friday.

> 「勤務」means "work" or "duty." The superior is bringing up the topic of work schedules. [starting a conversation]

**Jooshi / Superior**

その日は、シフト上、人が余ってしまうんです。  
*Sono hi wa, shifuto-joo, hito ga amatte shimau n desu.*  
On that day, according to the shift schedule, we have too many people.

> 「シフト」comes from English "shift." 「余る」means "to be left over" or "to have a surplus." 「人が余る」means there are more staff than needed. [giving factual information]

**Jooshi / Superior**

ワンさん、悪いんだけど、その日休みにしてもらえないかな。  
*Wan-san, warui n da kedo, sono hi yasumi ni shite moraenai ka na.*  
Uan-san, I'm sorry to ask, but could you take that day off?

> 「悪いんだけど」is a casual apology that softens the request. The superior is asking if the employee can adjust their schedule. [requesting]

**Student**

あ、はい。大丈夫です。  
*A, hai. Daijoobu desu.*  
Oh, yes. That's fine.

> The student quickly agrees to the request. [expressing agreement]

**Jooshi / Superior**

ありがとう。  
*Arigatoo.*  
Thank you.

### Later - Talking with a Coworker

**Dooryoo / Coworker**

ワンさん、来週の金曜日、お休みなんですか。  
*Wan-san, raishuu no kin-yoobi, oyasumi nan desu ka.*  
Uan-san, are you off next Friday?

> The coworker is confirming the schedule change. [asking for confirmation]

**Student**

ええ。  
*Ee.*  
Yes.

**Dooryoo / Coworker**

どうしてですか。体調が悪いんですか。  
*Dooshite desu ka. Taichoo ga warui n desu ka.*  
Why? Are you not feeling well?

> The coworker is concerned, thinking there might be a health issue. [asking for information]

### KEY PHRASE

**Student**

いえいえ、そういうわけではなくて。来週の金曜日は人員が多いので、調整が必要だと言われたんです。  
*Ieie, soo iu wake dewa nakute. Raishuu no kin-yoobi wa jinin ga ooi node, choosei ga hitsuyoo da to iwareta n desu.*  
No, no, it's not that. I was told that there are a lot of staff next Friday, so an adjustment is needed.

> 「そういうわけではなくて」means "it's not like that" or "that's not the reason." This clarifies a misunderstanding. 「人員」means "staff" or "personnel." 「調整」means "adjustment" or "coordination." 

> The phrase explains that the day off is not due to personal reasons but because of staffing needs. This is a clear, professional explanation. [giving factual information] [explaining a situation]

**Dooryoo / Coworker**

あぁ、そうなんですね。  
*Aa, soo na n desu ne.*  
Oh, I see.

> The coworker understands the situation. [expressing understanding]

**Student**

## Cultural Notes

### Flexibility in Japanese Work Schedules

In Japanese workplaces, especially in service industries like healthcare, employees are often expected to be flexible with their schedules. Key points:

1. **Company needs come first** - When asked to adjust your schedule, it's generally expected you'll accommodate if possible
2. **Clear communication** - Always explain the real reason for schedule changes to avoid misunderstandings
3. **Staffing adjustments** - Having too many or too few staff affects efficiency and costs
4. **No personal offense** - Being asked to take a day off due to overstaffing is normal business, not a reflection of your performance

### Explaining vs. Justifying

When explaining a schedule change to coworkers:
- Be matter-of-fact about company decisions
- Don't over-apologize for something that's not your choice
- Clarify it's not due to personal problems (which might worry colleagues)

## Grammar Points

### Using「そういうわけではなくて」to Clarify Misunderstandings

**Pattern:** そういうわけではなくて

This phrase means "it's not like that" or "that's not the reason" and is used to correct a misunderstanding.

**Examples:**
- 辞めたいというわけではありません。  
  (It's not that I want to quit.)
  
- 嫌いというわけではないです。  
  (It's not that I dislike it.)
  
- お金がないというわけではなくて、時間がないんです。  
  (It's not that I don't have money; I don't have time.)

### The Pattern「〜と言われた」for Reporting What You Were Told

**Pattern:** [Plain form] + と言われた

This passive form means "I was told that ~."

**Examples:**
- 明日来てくださいと言われました。  
  (I was told to come tomorrow.)
  
- もっと頑張れと言われた。  
  (I was told to try harder.)
  
- 問題ないと言われました。  
  (I was told there's no problem.)

### Using「〜んです」for Explanation

Adding「んです」(or「のです」) to the end of a sentence shows you're providing an explanation or reason.

**Examples:**
- 遅れたんです。電車が止まったんです。  
  (I was late. The train stopped.)
  
- 明日休むんです。病院に行くんです。  
  (I'm taking tomorrow off. I have to go to the hospital.)
