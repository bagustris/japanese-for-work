### Full Script & Explanation

#### 1. すみません。
**Sumimasen.**  
*Excuse me.*

- 「すみません」has many meanings. In this case, it's being used to get the listener's attention. You can use this phrase to get the attention of people you know, as well as strangers.

#### 2. どうしましたか。
**Doo shimashita ka.**  
*Can I help with something?*

#### 3. 部長から、この書類を斎藤さんに渡すように言われました。
**Buchoo kara, kono shorui o Saito-san ni watasu yoo ni iwaremashita.**  
*Buchoo asked me to give these documents to Saito-san.*

- 「～（人、会社）から～（する）ように言われました」(I was asked to do [task] by [person].) is an expression used to explain that you have been asked to do something by a third party.
- The meaning is the same as「部長がこの書類を斎藤さんに渡すように言いました」, but has been rearranged to be in passive voice.
- 「言いました」is used to relay a fact; the focus is that "someone told me something." When you are explaining that you have been asked to do something at work, use the passive voice like the example above.
- 「渡す」(to give) usually means 手渡し (to pass something by hand), and can't be used to say you mailed or emailed something. Instead, use verbs like these: 郵送する、メールする、郵送で送る、メールで送る.
- 「渡す」(to give) usually means 手渡し (to pass something by hand), and can't be used to say you mailed or emailed something. Instead, use verbs like these: 郵送する、メールする、郵送で送る、メールで送る.

#### 4. どのフロアにいる人か分かりますか。
**Dono furoa ni iru hito ka wakarimasu ka.**  
*Do you know what floor he is on?*

- This question combines「（その人は）どのフロアにいますか」(What floor is he on?) and「わかりますか」(Do you know?).
- You can also use「どの階にいる人か、わかりますか」, because「フロア」and「階」share the same meaning.
- Example: 「駅はどの方向にあるか、わかりますか」Do you know which direction the station is in?

#### 5. ああ。それなら、これを見るといいですよ。
**Aa. Sore nara, kore o miru to ii desu yo.**  
*In that case, look at this.*

- 「ああ。」is a casual expression that shows that you are reacting to what the speaker just said.
- 「それなら、これを見るといいですよ」is a useful phrase for giving helpful advice.
- 「それなら」refers to what you have just been asked.
- 「～といいですよ」is used to give clear advice.
- Examples:
  - A:「買い物をしたいんですが」(I want to go shopping.)
  - B. 「それなら（買い物なら）、原宿がいいですよ。」(In that case, you should go to Harajuku.)
  - 「それなら、あの店がいいですよ」(In that case, I recommend this shop.)

#### 6. これは全社員の配席表です。
**Kore wa zen shain no haisekihyoo desu.**  
*This is a seating chart for the whole office.*

- 配席表 is a seating chart that shows the locations of everyone in the office. Nowadays, many workplaces have seating charts that you can see from a computer or tablet.
- 全社員 means 社員全員 (all of the company's employees).

#### 7. これで確認できますよ。

*You can check with this.*

- 「これで確認できますよ」means「これを使って確認できます」. In this case, it means, "You can check where that person sits by using this seating chart."

#### 8. あ、斎藤さんは３階のこの席ですね。
**A, Saito-san wa san-gai no kono seki desu ne.**  
*Oh, Saito-san is on the third floor, in this seat.*

- 「あ、」is an expression of mild surprise.
- By adding「ね」to make 「～ですね」it adds the nuance that you would like to confirm that what you have just said is correct.

#### 9. わかりました。ありがとうございます。
**Wakarimashita. Arigatoo gozaimasu.**  
*Got it. Thank you.*

- 「わかりました」indicates that you understood what was just explained to you.

#### 10. あともう一つだけいいですか。
**Ato moo hitotsu dake ii desu ka.**  
*Can I ask you one more thing?*

- You can use「もう一つ質問があります」to let the listener know you have one more question.
- However,「あともう一つだけいいですか」asks the listener if it is okay to ask them another question.
- Saying「あと」is optional.
- To be more polite, use「すみません、もう一つだけ質問をしてもよろしいでしょうか」.

#### 11. 取引先の遠藤さんにメールを送りたいのですが、連絡先がわからなくて。
**Torihikisaki no Endoo-san ni meeru o okuritai no desu ga, renrakusaki ga wakaranakute.**  
*I want to send an email to our client Endo-san, but I don't know his contact information.*

- This question combines several ideas:「取引先の遠藤さんにメールを送りたいです。でも、連絡先がわかりません。教えてください」(I want to send an email to our client Endo-san. But I don't know his contact information. Do you know?).
- 「送りたいのですが」or「送りたいんですが」are both acceptable.「の」is slightly more polite, but「ん」is used more frequently.
- Even though「連絡先がわからなくて」doesn't make a full sentence, through context the listener still understands that the speaker would like to learn the contact information.

#### 12. それなら、部長に聞くといいですよ。
**Sore nara, buchoo ni kiku to ii desu yo.**  
*In that case, you should ask Buchoo.*

#### 13. 遠藤さんと以前、仕事をしていましたから。
**Endoo-san to izen, shigoto o shite imashita kara.**  
*He used to work with Endo-san.*

- The subject of the sentence, Buchoo, is omitted. The full sentence could look like this:「（部長は）遠藤さんと」.
- The order could also be rearranged like this:「以前、遠藤さんと仕事をしていましたから」.
- By bringing Endo-san to the front of the sentence, the emphasis is placed on Endo-san.
- In Japanese, the word order in a sentence can be flexible, so the order of sentences can often be changed in this way.

#### 14. わかりました。ありがとうございます。
**Wakarimashita. Arigatoo gozaimasu.**  
*Understood. Thank you.*

### Cultural Notes

**Giving and Receiving Advice in Japanese Workplaces**

Japanese workplace culture values cooperation and helping newcomers. Key points:

1. **Asking for help is expected**: New employees are expected to ask questions rather than struggle alone
2. **Specific advice over vague directions**: The colleague doesn't just say "check the chart"—they show it and explain how to use it
3. **Building relationships through gratitude**: Repeatedly thanking helpful colleagues strengthens workplace bonds
4. **Chain of knowledge**: The colleague doesn't have all the information but directs the employee to someone who does (Buchoo)
5. **Using tools and resources**: Modern workplaces have digital seating charts and employee databases—knowing how to use them is important

**The Pattern of Asking Multiple Questions**

Notice how the new employee:
- Asks permission before asking another question (「あともう一つだけいいですか」)
- Thanks the person after each piece of help
- Doesn't assume they should know everything on their first day

- Used to explain you're acting on someone else's instructions
- More natural in Japanese than active voice in this context

- **Pattern:** Verb (plain) + のですが / んですが
- **Meaning:** Provides context, "the thing is..." / "I want to... but..."
- **Example:** 送りたいのですが (I want to send, but...)
- Often implies an unspoken request or problem
- 「の」is slightly more formal than「ん」

#### 6. Incomplete Sentences with ～て/～くて
