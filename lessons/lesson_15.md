コストを下げるために、ここの部品を変えました。
I changed this part to reduce the cost.
今ちょっとお時間いいですか。 Do you have a moment?
When beginning a conversation in the workplace, it&apos;s important to ask if the person you would like to speak with has the time to talk. Rather than immediately diving into the 用件（ようけん）(main topic), use phrases like this to show the listener that you value their time.
It is fine to omit「お時間」to make「今ちょっといいですか」. To be more polite, use 「今（お時間）よろしいでしょうか」.
ああ、いいですよ。Sure.
In this case, this phrase carries the same meaning as「はい、今、話しても大丈夫ですよ」. When speaking to a superior, use 「はい、何でしょうか」or 「はい、大丈夫です」.
あの、設計図の変更が終わりました。
Well, I finished making the changes to the diagram.
「あの」is used to get the attention of the listener. This statement is made to let the superior know that the 作業（さぎょう）(work or task) has been finished.
It is very important, especially when working on a team, to let others know what stage your work is at by making 報告（ほうこく）(reports).
そうですか。じゃあ、ちょっと見せてください。 Oh, really. Could you just give me a look?
In this case, although the speaker is using「ちょっと見せてください」, this may in fact mean that the speaker would prefer a 詳しい（くわしい）(detailed) explanation.
When making reports, it is a good idea not just to show the final product, but to make an easy-to-understand 説明（せつめい）(explanation) of the process.
前回のものと、どこが変わりましたか。 What&apos;s new about this design?
The speaker is asking the listener to explain the 変更点（へんこうてん）(changes).
「どこが」can be substituted for「なにが」in some cases.
This phrase is likely to be used when 試作品（しさくひん）(prototypes) are being remade, or when meeting agendas or schedules have been changed.
コストを下げるために、ここの部品を変えました。 I changed this part to reduce the cost.
This phrase is expressing two ideas: that the part was changed, and that this was done to reduce cost.
In the fast-paced business world, phrases like this are useful to save time. 「ために」can be used to explain「原因」(causes) and 「結果」(effects).
For example,
「部品を変えたために試作品は少し大きくなりました」Since this part was changed, the prototype is a little bigger now.
In this case, since you are explaining something that has already happened, the past tense is used before 「ために」.
Kanji: 変「へん」、変更
「へんこう」 alteration, 大変「たいへん」 terrible, 変える「かえる」 to change
なるほど。少し部品が大きくなったようですね。 I see. It looks like this part is a bit larger now.
「なるほど」is a phrase used to convey the idea that the explanation was understood. 「〜ようですね」(looks like, seems that) is used to show that a speaker&apos;s perception of something has changed based on what has been seen or heard. In this case, the speaker is recalling previous versions of the design that they saw, or explanations that they previously heard.

特にありません。Yes, there is no problem.
When you believe there is no problem, be sure to directly say so.　Rather than 「ありません」, use「特にありません」to give a softer impression.　If there is something that you are concerned about, use this phrase to ask for advice:
「問題ではないのですが、一つ気になることがあります」(There is no problem, but there is one part I am worried about.)
そうですか。じゃあこれで次の作業を始めてください。
I see. In that case, please begin the next step.
Since both parties agree that this part of the process is finished, the speaker is letting the listener know that it is okay to move on to the next step. In the workplace, it is vital to share the status of projects step-by-step when working. 「じゃあこれで」shows the shift to the next step.
わかりました。Understood.
This phrase is being used to show acceptance of orders. If you are not sure what is being asked of you, then to clarify use phrases like「次に何をすればいいでしょうか」(What should I do next?) or「次の作業は～でいいでしょうか」(Should I do ~ next?).
Words from this Dialogue
ちょっと
a little
「ちょっと」often has the same meaning as「少し」. However, 「ちょっと」 can also be used in a way that 「少し」can not.
For instance, although you might be asked「ちょっと見せてください」(Could you just give me a look?) , the person asking may actually want a detailed explanation.
Similarly, 「ちょっと時間ある？」(Do you have just a minute?) can actually end up being much more than just a minute. Depending on the situation and other factors, you must rely on context to know what the listener really wants. When you aren&apos;t certain, make sure to ask.
ちょっと時間をくださいCan you give me just a minute?
ちょっと手伝ってもらいたいんだけどI&apos;d like a little help with something.
