# Lesson 16: そこを何とか、ご検討いただけませんでしょうか。

#16
Handling difficult negotiations over the phone
そこを何とか、ご検討いただけませんでしょうか。
Could you please reconsider?
はい、EJ商事です。
Hello, this is EJ Trading.
When answering the phone, be sure to clearly state the name of your company and your department. In the business world, 「もしもし」is not used. To be more polite, use 「でございます」rather than「です」.
大変お世話になっております。
Thank you very much, as always.
When interacting with suppliers or clients over the phone, greeting with 「お世話になっております」 is customary. It is used to mean「いつもありがとうございます」.
Ｋ＆Ｌ社の劉と申しますが、和田様はいらっしゃいますでしょうか。
This is Liu with K&amp;L Company. Is Wada-sama there?
When making a call, be sure to state your company and your own name first. Then, ask for the person you would like to speak to, adding 「～様」on to the end of their name. 「～さん」may also be acceptable in some cases, but for someone you don&apos;t know well, it may not be sufficiently polite. 「いらっしゃいますでしょうか」is a more polite way to ask「いますか」.
ああ、劉さん。和田です。
Oh, Liu-san. This is Wada.
When taking a call, use 「はい、◯◯です」to let the caller know that you have answered. 「◯◯でございます」is even more polite. From the context of this interaction, we can conclude that Wada-san and Liu-san know each other fairly well.
和田さんですか。あの、実は一つお願いがあるんですが。
Oh, Wada-san. I have a favor that I need to ask of you.
Once you have confirmed who you are speaking with, it&apos;s time to get down to business. 「あの、実は」is often used to precede asking a favor or bringing up a new or unpleasant subject. 「あの」is not necessary, but it adds a buffer and shows more consideration.
はい、何でしょうか。
Sure, what is it?
「何でしょうか」is used to politely and briefly ask what the listener needs from you. 「何ですか」is a little too abrupt. Since we can&apos;t see the face of the person we speak with on the phone, it is better to be more polite when in doubt.
先日発注した材料の件なんですが、納期を早めていただけないでしょうか。
It&apos;s about the materials I ordered the other day. Would it be possible to move up the delivery date?
「～A～の件なんですが、～B～ていただけませんか」is a formula for politely asking favors. Just add the topic you&apos;d like to discuss in A, and B the specific request you have of the listener. By changing「～ませんか」to「～ないでしょうか」, you can make this phrase more polite. Using a formula like this makes it easy to clarify what specific topic and task you are referring to.
納期は来月の15日でしたよね。
The delivery was scheduled for the 15th of next month, right?
The speaker is clarifying something that both the speaker and listener already know (the delivery date). Adding 「よね」at the end of the sentence is common in situations like this.
はい。それを、今月末にしていただけませんか。
Yes. I was wondering if it could be moved up to the end of this month.
The speaker is using「それ」to refer to the topic at hand. By putting「それを」at the beginning of the sentence, it creates greater emphasis.「来月15日の納期を今月末にする」is using the formula「AをBにする」to mean &quot;change A to B.&quot; Changing delivery dates is often difficult, and may cause problems for business associates, so it is better to be polite and use「～ていただけませんか」in cases like these.
今月末ですか。 それはちょっと…。
The end of this month? Hm, that&apos;s a bit...
「今月末ですか」is being used to repeat the last point back to the listener. It is also being used to show surprise.「それはちょっと…」is used to mean that something is difficult or likely impossible to do. With business associates, it is important to be polite, so avoid using too-direct phrases like「できません」.
実は急な発注があって、材料が足りなくなりそうなんです。
Well, we&apos;ve just gotten in a sudden order.
Our supplies of the material are about to run out.
The speaker is explaining why a big request like this had to be made. 「実は」is sometimes used to ask for favors, or when beginning a difficult conversation. When you use 「実は」, the listener understands that some special circumstances may prevail. 「そうなんです」is a combination of「そう（です）＋ ～なん です」, and is used to report on the condition of something. Using「（な）んです」is a way to ask for the listener&apos;s kind understanding.
そうですか... 難しいと思うんですよ。
I see... but I still think it&apos;s probably not possible.
「そうですか」shows that the speaker understands the situation. By using「難しい」, the speaker lets the listener know that it will be incredibly difficult and likely impossible to accommodate their request. 「～んですよ」is used to ask for the listener&apos;s understanding.
そこを何とか、ご検討いただけませんでしょうか。
Could you please reconsider?
Phrases like 「そこを何とか、ご検討いただけませんか」and「何とか、お願いできませんか」are used during difficult negotiations. 「そこを何とか」is used to show that you understand the listener&apos;s difficult position, but that you must ask for their reconsideration in spite of that.
Kanji:
討「とう
」、討論「とうろん」debate, 検討「けんとう」
consideration, ご検討　to consider
じゃあ、社内で一度相談してみます。
In that case, we will consider it internally.
「じゃあ」is a more casual way of saying「では」. The 「～てみます」in 「相談してみます」shows that the speaker will give something a try. 「相談してみます」means that the speaker will try to move up the delivery date, but there is no guarantee that they will be successful. Rather than making an on-the-spot decision, considering internally means that a final decision can be made later.
ありがとうございます。ご連絡お待ちしております。
Thank you. I&apos;ll wait to hear from you.
It&apos;s important for the speaker to thank the listener, as a big request was made.「ご連絡お待ちしております」is a more formal way to say「連絡を待っています」.
Words from this Dialogue
納期　「のうき」
delivery, lead time
「納期」is a shortened version of「納入期限(のうにゅうきげん)」, and means the time by which an　order must be delivered. Many Japanese businesses place high importance on protecting set　delivery dates. 「納期」isn&apos;t just limited to the delivery of physical items, but can also mean the time by which a task or service needs to be finished.
納期を守る（まもる）following the set delivery date
納期が迫る（せまる）the delivery date is coming up
納期遅れ（おくれ）delivery delay
標準（ひょうじゅん）納期standard delivery time
相談「そうだん」
consultation, advice
You may often need time to consider things with other members of your company rather than providing an immediate answer. Japanese companies with foreign offices may need to consult with the head office in Japan before making big decisions, as in many cases the head office may have decision-making power. When someone tells you 「相談してみます」, you can
respond with「返事（へんじ）はいつごろいただけますか」to ask when you might expect a response.
相談中（そうだんちゅう）under consideration
要相談（ようそうだん）requires consultation
相談に乗るto provide advice
相談を持ち掛ける（もちかける）to consult someone
