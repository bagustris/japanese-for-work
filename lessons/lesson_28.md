#28
Checking that others have understood instructions
大事な内容なので、念のため確認させてください。
This is important, so please let me confirm just to be sure.
消毒液についてですが、在庫がなくなりそうな場合は、必ず２日前までに総務に連絡してください。
This is about disinfectant. Contact General Affairs at least two days before we run out.
The speaker is talking about a workplace situation and a potential solution. The phrase「在庫がなくなりそう」refers to a situation where a supply is running out. The speaker is letting the staff members know to order more disinfectant when supplies are low, and not to wait until they&apos;ve run out. The phrase「〜についてですが」is used to share the topic, and the phrase「〜場合は」shows the situation. The phrase「必ず（期日）までに〜てください」gives specific instructions on how to deal with that situation. This combination of phrases is useful, so it may be a good idea to memorize it. Here&apos;s an example:「会議室の備品についてですが、他の会議室のものを使う場合は、必ずその旨を総務に連絡してください」(This is about the supplies in the meeting room. Let General Affairs know if you&apos;re going to use supplies from another meeting room.)
はい。
Okay.
土日はカウントされませんので、月曜日に必要な場合は、木曜日までに連絡してください。
That doesn&apos;t include the weekend. So if a new delivery is needed on Monday, contact them by Thursday.
Saturday and Sunday (土曜日と日曜日) are referred to collectively as 「土日」. You can use this construction for other days of the week, too, like Monday and Tuesday「月火（げつか・げっか）」. Note that the pronunciation may vary slightly. In the business world, it&apos;s common to count days using business/operating days only. When in doubt, it&apos;s a good idea to confirm these sorts of things using this construction.
皆さん、よろしいですか。
Understood?
The chief is checking to make sure that the staff members have all understood, and that there are no questions. When speaking to a group that may include superiors, it&apos;s a good idea to use 「よろしいでしょうか」.
はい。
Yes.
ショウエンさん、ちょっといいかな。
Shang Yan-san, can I have a word?
When asking someone for a quick word, it&apos;s best to use their name first to create a sense of closeness. The phrase「ちょっといいかな」lets the speaker ask the listener if now is a good time for a chat. When asking a superior for a word, use the phrase「少々よろしいでしょうか」.
はい、何でしょうか。
Sure, what is it?
In response, the speaker first answers with 「はい」. Instead of following up with 「何ですか」it&apos;s more polite to use「何でしょうか」. This phrase lets the listener know that the speaker is prepared to hear what they have to say.
和田さんは、まだ入って２週間だったよね。
Wada-san only joined two weeks ago, right?
The phrase「入って２週間」means「会社に入ってから、２週間が経った」(It&apos;s been two weeks since he has joined.). The word「まだ」shows that the speaker thinks this is a comparatively short amount of time. 「よね」is used to confirm.
そうです。
That&apos;s right.
間違いがあるといけないから、さっきの指示がどこまで分かっているか、聞いてみてくれる？
We can&apos;t be having any mistakes. Can you ask him how much he understood of what I just said?
Disinfectant is very important when cleaning. The chief wants to make sure that there will be no potential problems, but it would be unpleasant to ask if Wada-san understood in front of the whole group. So instead, he asks Wada-san&apos;s senpai to check with Wada-san instead. The phrase「〜てくれる？」is used by superiors to subordinates, and to people close with each other, to make casual requests.
分かりました。
Got it.
和田さん、隣いいですか。
Wada-san, can I sit here?
This phrase means the same thing as「隣に座ってもいいですか」. 「お」 can also be added in front of this phrase to read「お隣、いいですか」. In this case, we can tell that the speaker is trying to begin a conversation.
はい、どうぞ。
Sure, go ahead.
先ほどの朝礼の話、分かりましたか。
Did you understand what was said at the meeting just now?
The word 朝礼 refers to morning group meetings held at school or in the workplace at the beginning of the day. In the workplace, people share information and relay messages at these meetings.
The phrase「先ほどの朝礼の話、分かりましたか」omits 「が」after 「話」. The phrase「先ほど」means the same thing as 少し前. It&apos;s a fairly polite phrase, and it&apos;s often used in the business world.
例）先ほど電話がありました。Ex.) There was a phone call for you just now.
分かりました。
Yes, I did.
大事な内容なので、念のため確認させてください。
This is important, so please let me confirm just to be sure.
The phrase「念のため」basically means「分かっているとは思うけれど、行き違いがないように」(I think you understood, but I just want to make sure.) . The phrase「大事な内容なので」shows that the speaker is double-checking because the information is important. This avoids hurting the listener&apos;s feelings, and provides a reasonable justification for an insistence on checking. Communicating in this way avoids creating negative feelings for the listener.
はい。消毒液の在庫がなくなりそうなときは、２日前までに総務に連絡します。
Okay. When it looks like the disinfectant is going to run out, contact General Affairs at least two days in advance.
The speaker is responding to the listener&apos;s request, and is explaining what he has just heard at the morning meeting in his own words. In this way, the two can make a verbal check, and ensure that there has been no misunderstanding.
土日はカウントされません。
That doesn&apos;t include Saturdays and Sundays.
The speaker continues his explanation to say that Saturdays and Sundays don&apos;t count.
ありがとうございます。
Thank you.
確認できて良かったです。
I&apos;m glad we were able to confirm that.
